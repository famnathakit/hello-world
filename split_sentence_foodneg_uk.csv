14781,14781,5599,0,So been away for over a year....thought let me give Uber another try to redeem their honor.,,17
14782,14782,5599,1,This IS BY FAR THE WORST app i have ever had to use as for getting back.... No way to log on without my original number...no way to change no way in as its linked to my email....a long story short...not a pleasure... and by all means try and make me l99k like an idiot i double dare you!,,59

14784,14784,5599,3,Ps im a software tester.....by profession,,6
14785,14785,5600,0,the food i ordered fell out in the drivers car which is annoying but not a huge problem.,,18
14786,14786,5600,1,however when i tried to get a refund for the order they kept sending me the same automated message saying ‚Äòthe driver tried to call you and waited for 14 minutes‚Äô which is untrue but also irrelevant because my food was spilt on the floor??,,45
14787,14787,5600,2,i‚Äôm still trying to get a refund and i‚Äôm having no luck it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm talking to a wall except the wall is either a robot or an incompetent customer service employee,,32

14802,14802,5603,0,The process to cancel an order is grueling and honestly much harder than it has to be.,,17
14803,14803,5603,1,For example there could be a five minute wait time before your order is sent through to the restaurant that would allow users to make changes or cancel their orders before being charged.,,33
14804,14804,5603,2,All in all the app is useful but brings me pain to use.,,13
14805,14805,5603,3,"Edit- The app is no longer accepting my card, called my bank and its not a problem on that end.",,20
14806,14806,5603,4,"Ordered off uber eats instead, cheaper delivery too.",,8

15881,15881,5788,5,I will say that most of the time it does resolve in a refund but that‚Äôs pointless after waiting an hour and half the order arrives.,,26
15882,15882,5788,6,By this time you starving and just want the food that was ordered.,,13
15883,15883,5788,7,The main reason for this review is because the support from Uber when something goes wrong is dismal and I need to share that.,,24

15969,15969,5800,2,The the restaurant called and said they were confused cause the same or Dd twice.,,15
15970,15970,5800,3,I said we waited so long for the food we weren‚Äôt sure if the order went through but at this point we didn‚Äôt want the food anymore so I asked the restaurant to cancel and refund and they said Uber would do that.,,43
15971,15971,5800,4,So I contacted Uber and they refunded one order but as of today they still haven‚Äôt refunded the second one and every time I email them they say it‚Äôs coming.,,30
15972,15972,5800,5,This has been going on for 2weeks still no full refund.,,11
15973,15973,5800,6,Disappointed.,,1
15974,15974,5800,7,And now every time I email them they send me a unpersonalised template email saying I cancelled too late even though I have emails cancelling the same day and emails saying the refund is coming.,,35
15975,15975,5800,8,Very disgusting how customer service!,,5
15976,15976,5800,9,Go with a different food app this one does not care about customer service!,,14
15977,15977,5800,10,!üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº,,1
15978,15978,5801,0,I am VERY disappointed.,,4
15979,15979,5801,1,Customer service is nill.,,4
15980,15980,5801,2,I have ordered food using this app 5 times in the past month and not once have they got my order correctly.,,22
15981,15981,5801,3,"90% of the time half of my order was missing, the remaining 10% they gave me someone elses order.",,19
15982,15982,5801,4,Sometimes the food sent to me (wrongly) contained ingredients I am allergic to and goes against my religious dietary requirements.,,20
15983,15983,5801,5,The rest of the time my husband has to sit and watch me eat because his part of the order didnt arrive.,,22
15984,15984,5801,6,The only silver lining in this initially was that uber eats support gave me full refunds.,,16
15985,15985,5801,7,"However, today they messed up my order AGAIN and only gave my a partial refund even though they have caused a massive invonvenience and a waste of time.",,28
15986,15986,5801,8,I asked for a full refund as compensation and all I got was ‚Äúit goes against our policy‚Äù and ‚Äúno worries‚Äù.,,21
15987,15987,5801,9,I will be taking legal action because this is ridiculous.,,10
15988,15988,5801,10,Cancel the whole company please!,,5
15989,15989,5801,11,JustEat is so much better!,,5
15990,15990,5802,0,On July 8th I placed two orders with Uber Eats.,,10
15991,15991,5802,1,The money was removed from my account immediately as usual.,,10
15992,15992,5802,2,After the second order was delivered the App said one of the payments didn‚Äôt go through.,,16
15993,15993,5802,3,I emailed support with the screenshots showing I was in fact charged and it was in fact paid.,,18
15994,15994,5802,4,"They told me to just allow time, I obliged.",,9
15995,15995,5802,5,A week later it was still there and now the Uber Eats App tries to debit my account an additional $30 at least 10 times a day.,,27
15996,15996,5802,6,I reached out to at least 7 customer service agents and they ALL keep telling me to just go ahead and pay it again and then they will investigate whether or not I‚Äôll be refunded.,,35
15997,15997,5802,7,"Seriously, they said that, I have that screenshot proof as well!",,11
15998,15998,5802,8,"I told them that would be stealing from me, the same way them trying to debit my account for more money is stealing.",,23
15999,15999,5802,9,Especially when I and my bank can prove that it‚Äôs paid!,,11
16000,16000,5802,10,I joined a class action lawsuit yesterday!,,7
16001,16001,5803,0,Consistently Miss items off order.,,5
16002,16002,5803,1,Latest order was Saturday in which yet again they missed the main part of the offer.,,16
16003,16003,5803,2,Icing on the cake was that the rest of the food was freezing cold!,,14
16004,16004,5803,3,Notified them straight away then received a message saying I wasn‚Äôt eligible for a refund as the order was over 42 hours.,,22
16005,16005,5803,4,Despite sending multiple screenshots of my complaint which was sent within minutes of receiving the order they moved on to their usual tactic of just sending generic response after generic response.,,31
16006,16006,5803,5,The food was completely inedible and chicken so completely unsafe to eat.,,12
16007,16007,5803,6,My advice would be if you fancy giving Salmonella a go use Uber Eats but honestly Deliveroo and Just Eat are light years ahead of this  abysmal company.,,28
16008,16008,5803,7,Possibly the worst customer service I have ever come across in my life.,,13
16009,16009,5803,8,"Refused to offer any contact with complaints manager, I‚Äôve been forced to forward all screenshots and messages to the Food Standards Agency.",,22
16010,16010,5803,9,Avoid this company like the plague they could not care less about their customers.,,14
16011,16011,5804,0,"I placed a order at my Local McDonald‚Äôs VIA the Uber eats app and had a expected twenty minutes wait (that‚Äôs okay and expected) the food arrived approximately a hour after my order was placed, The driver was extremely rude to myself and family and threatened to take my food back and refused to hand it over.",,57
16012,16012,5804,1,"His excuse is because he went to the wrong address and kept knocking on their door to which they got frustrated and shouted at him for waking them up, he told me it‚Äôs unacceptable on my part for him going to the wrong address and not answering when he called me on the app(which he didn‚Äôt do).",,57
16013,16013,5804,2,When complained to Uber they said that there is nothing they can do and I am not entitled to any Credit or refund for this order.,,26
16014,16014,5804,3,I will never be using Uber eats or Uber in general and urge everyone to stay away as customers satisfaction is their lowest priority where as money is their top.,,30
16015,16015,5804,4,Just eat or deliveroo is by far better 8======D,,9
16016,16016,5805,0,"I can‚Äôt even say I‚Äôve made an order yet, as each time I try I get an error and am told to ‚Äòtry again later‚Äô.",,25
16017,16017,5805,1,"Don‚Äôt even bother with underrates, it‚Äôll waste all of your time verifying information for the app to then not even work.",,21
16018,16018,5805,2,"Like with all the other reviews, the customer service is non existent, so pray you don‚Äôt encounter any issues when you make an order!",,24
16019,16019,5805,3,"Additionally, the promotional codes very rarely work and again when they do, the app breaks and won‚Äôt let you order anything.",,21
16020,16020,5805,4,"I have attempted to make numerous accounts, and have tried the website as well as the app, but to no avail.",,21
16021,16021,5805,5,"If I was counting on Uber eats to deliver my food, I‚Äôd have starved to death by now!",,18
16022,16022,5805,6,"Stick to just eat or something, I‚Äôm deleting this app and I‚Äôll continue to share my concerns with friends and fellow members, since Uber eats don‚Äôt want to hear anything from their customers, so long as they get that money they ain‚Äôt bothered.",,43
16023,16023,5805,7,Outdated company and an outdated app.,,6
16024,16024,5806,0,I am angry and disappointed with Uber for the past month!,,11
16025,16025,5806,1,"They just hire anyone, so far I lost ¬£56 and didn‚Äôt get my meal because the driver didn‚Äôt attempt to deliver the food and informed the company that they couldn‚Äôt reach me‚Ä¶.. their customer service is horrible, when reporting they are happy to keep my money and to make matters worse ask me to rate the driver and the restaurant!!!",,60
16026,16026,5806,2,"Uber ears are the biggest crooks on earth, you purposely don‚Äôt have a number for complaints because you know what you are doing!!!",,23
16027,16027,5806,3,I understand some people try to scam you but doesn‚Äôt mean we are all the same!!,,16
16028,16028,5806,4,You don‚Äôt know how hard I have to work to make my money just so you can steal it from me and eat my food and then refuse to reimburse because some of your drivers are thieves and untrained employees.,,40
16029,16029,5806,5,I only used it because you have my favourite restaurants in there or else I would not but I am definitely trying a different company!,,25
16030,16030,5806,6,Caused me anxiety and stress,,5
16031,16031,5807,0,Orders are routinely cancelled with no reason given or you just sit there for hours for a delivery that doesn‚Äôt come.,,21
16032,16032,5807,1,Uber makes it deliberately very difficult to contact customer service.,,10
16033,16033,5807,2,"There is no contact number given via the app, if you want to speak to someone to get an update on your order you have to hunt for it online.",,30
16034,16034,5807,3,Often when using Ubereats I end up being late for things because I‚Äôm waiting for an order that doesn‚Äôt appear.,,20
16035,16035,5807,4,On my latest order it said it would take 15-20 minutes.,,11
16036,16036,5807,5,As soon as the order was accepted it was updated to wait over 1 hour.,,15
16037,16037,5807,6,"90 minutes later I try and get an update on the order, I was directed to call the restaurant directly which I did, and their phone number wasn‚Äôt working.",,29
16038,16038,5807,7,"The best customer service will do is cancel your order, you are then left hungry after 2 hours with no food and late for wherever you need to be.",,29
16039,16039,5807,8,"Just stick to Deliveroo or other food delivery options, I have had too many bad experiences with this app.",,19
16040,16040,5808,0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,,4
16041,16041,5808,1,1 star is too many for this lot of con artists.,,11
16042,16042,5808,2,They must spend millions on TV adverts and spamming leaflet letter box offers looking for new mugs to hand over their money to them.,,24
16043,16043,5808,3,Unfortunately I was one of those who fell victim to their letterbox mailing and wasted my time signing up to order a local Pizza on Tuesday 20th around 5.30.,,29
16044,16044,5808,4,When it got to 8PM I had to call them only to be told the restaurant had delivered it.,,19
16045,16045,5808,5,"That was simply not true, I even had a car detailer all evening on my driveway doing my car who some no one!",,23
16046,16046,5808,6,"Anyway you would think that would be the end of the matter, an apology and a refund but no.",,19
16047,16047,5808,7,"They are disputing my story, insisting it was delivered (they have the correct address - have checked) and even claiming the delivery driver tried to call me!",,27
16048,16048,5808,8,So now I am left trying to get my bank to refund me or issue a claim in the small claims court.,,22
16049,16049,5808,9,Jeez.,,1
16050,16050,5808,10,PLEASE AVOID THIS BUNCH OF MONKIES AT ALL COSTS !!,,10
16051,16051,5808,11,!,,1
16052,16052,5809,0,I‚Äôm writing this review as I‚Äôve now had 2 issues with Uber Eats.,,13
16053,16053,5809,1,Uber for taxis is an awesome service but their food delivery is shocking.,,13
16054,16054,5809,2,It‚Äôs the first company I‚Äôve came across that the customer is never right ?,,14
16055,16055,5809,3,The latest issue I ordered McDonalds breakfast.,,7
16056,16056,5809,4,"The driver came to my door, I paid for the food as normal.",,13
16057,16057,5809,5,He then opened his bag and had no food inside ?,,11
16058,16058,5809,6,Then looking as shocked as I was returned my money.,,10
16059,16059,5809,7,The driver then proceeded to claim that I wasn‚Äôt at home !,,12
16060,16060,5809,8,End result the driver is correct I‚Äôm at fault and Uber customer service informed me that I must pay for a product I didn‚Äôt receive.,,25
16061,16061,5809,9,My first issue the driver kept the restaurant‚Äôs money and said I took the food and didn‚Äôt pay ???,,19
16062,16062,5809,10,Why wouldn‚Äôt the police come to my door to resolve the issue as it‚Äôs all on camera ?,,18
16063,16063,5809,11,Completely disgusting the manner in which Uber customer services handled both cases.,,12
16064,16064,5809,12,If you want your money I‚Äôm more than happy to open a case as I have evidence and you have nothing !,,22
16065,16065,5809,13,Goodbye,,1
16066,16066,5810,0,This company has to have the most single handedly undefeated appauling customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life.,,21
16067,16067,5810,1,"On numerous occasions either the restaurant or driver forgets an item for my order which is extremely frequent, the food arrived either cold or in an absolutely disgusting matter and is unedible and when brought to the attetion of the customer service team I am told ""Unfortunately there is nothing we can do"".",,53
16068,16068,5810,2,This company is garbage and totally useless.,,7
16069,16069,5810,3,You can never get in contact with a real person you only recieve scripted automated replies 10/10 i dont think I have ever spoken to a real person before.,,29
16070,16070,5810,4,The delivery charges are daylight robbery and absolutely absurd.,,9
16071,16071,5810,5,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.,,5
16072,16072,5810,6,You're better off with JustEat or Deliveroo.,,7
16073,16073,5810,7,I have never the kind of issues there that I have with Uber and this is a company i have spent over ¬£1000 on the entire 2 years I have held the account and to think i get treated like absolute dirt Im appalled and will never be using them again.,,51
16074,16074,5810,8,PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NO USE UBEREATS.,,10
16075,16075,5811,0,I should preface this by saying I am diagnosed with severe anxiety and PTSD.,,14
16076,16076,5811,1,"Over a month ago I ordered some coffee from Starbucks and the Deliverer was exceptionally aggressive toward me, I was terrified.",,21
16077,16077,5811,2,"I went to pick up the bag off the doorstep, but the paper bag was so wet that it split and spilt all over the doorstep and even the carpet inside the house.",,33
16078,16078,5811,3,"The guy didn‚Äôt even say sorry, he just shrugged and walked away.",,12
16079,16079,5811,4,"I tried contacting customer service, they wanted to give me just eat credit but I wanted an actual refund as I never intend on using the service again, mainly due to how the deliverer was.",,35
16080,16080,5811,5,"They said that wasn‚Äôt possible as they would still need to take an admin fee, so I asked why I should have to pay for a random man to come and scare me in my own home and a huge coffee stain on my carpet?",,45
16081,16081,5811,6,They then promised management would contact me within 74 hours.,,10
16082,16082,5811,7,"This was on May 9th 2021, it‚Äôs now June 4th 2021 and I‚Äôm still waiting fir that call.",,18
16083,16083,5811,8,This is utterly abysmal and I‚Äôm not sure how this is legal.,,12
16084,16084,5812,0,***The positive reviews contain many reviews for restaurants and not JE*** Go with Uber Eats instead or even Deliveroo.,,19
16085,16085,5812,1,The Just Eat app is shockingly bad.,,7
16086,16086,5812,2,"For example, I placed an order and paid for that order.",,11
16087,16087,5812,3,The app then gives me an upper and lower limit on delivery time.,,13
16088,16088,5812,4,"Then 59 minutes AFTER the latest possible delivery time, the application tells me that they‚Äôre still waiting for a driver and the restaurant hasn‚Äôt started preparing the order.",,28
16089,16089,5812,5,Obviously in the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô those two assertions can‚Äôt be simultaneously true.,,12
16090,16090,5812,6,It gets worse tho - then six minutes after those 59 minutes past the latest possible delivery time.,,18
16091,16091,5812,7,The app tells me the order has been delivered.,,9
16092,16092,5812,8,"Of course it‚Äôs not reasonably possible and had not, but their inept system has maybe registered a time out on the order and defaulted its status to complete.",,28
16093,16093,5812,9,"So two hours after I started this nonsense ordeal, I ordered the same thing from Uber Eats.",,17
16094,16094,5812,10,"25 minutes later it arrives, bang on time and in exact synchronisation with what the application is telling me.",,19
16095,16095,5812,11,"I‚Äôm now eating my food from Uber Eats as I wait for my JE refund, having just deleted the app for good :)",,23
16096,16096,5813,0,avoid when deals offered for you!,,6
16097,16097,5813,1,i have now deleted this app.,,6
16098,16098,5813,2,Its not just me - I have heard way too many of my friends complaining about being ripped off by them.,,21
16099,16099,5813,3,"You put your order together, saying its 30% off when you spend ¬£20, trouble starts when something is out of stock - so you end up paying full price plus a small order fee.",,34
16100,16100,5813,4,Without any notice you have been charged easily ¬£20 EXTRA.,,10
16101,16101,5813,5,You can‚Äôt cancel the order and because of covid you can not return it to the driver.,,17
16102,16102,5813,6,So this is just forced on you.,,7
16103,16103,5813,7,"Also dear uber, Sainsburys is not an asset for you ,they are sending out liquified- rotten  bags of sald and nasty things.",,22
16104,16104,5813,8,We have complained about it  and I had to face the rudest customer service.,,14
16105,16105,5813,9,Also missing items in the order- you dont get a refund unless you dont take a picture of it.,,19
16106,16106,5813,10,of the missing item.,,4
16107,16107,5813,11,"I have worked in high-end customer service for many years now , I know how nasty people can get when complaining- so I am normally avoiding being a Karen, but I feel like I need to warn people before they get ripped off.",,43
16108,16108,5813,12,sorry.,,1
16109,16109,5813,13,its a no from me.,,5
16110,16110,5814,0,"Once, twice, thrice... how many times am I going to go through such horrible service.",,15
16111,16111,5814,1,"Never have been through such a deceiving, abysmal experience.",,9
16112,16112,5814,2,"Countless times my order was wrong, yet I was not eligible for refunds, still at least I had food.",,19
16113,16113,5814,3,BUT THIS TIME !!!!,,4
16114,16114,5814,4,"I ordered from McDonald‚Äôs at night, my family is vegetarian so I ordered 4x fish o fillet, and two cheese bite boxes.",,22
16115,16115,5814,5,"I kid you not the cheese bites were replaced with chicken selects, and all 4 fish burgers were bacon Big Macs, I WAS SHOCKED !",,25
16116,16116,5814,6,"There was about 12 fries in each packet, and I ordered large!",,12
16117,16117,5814,7,"This was the worst bit, the drinks were WATER.",,9
16118,16118,5814,8,"Like full on tap water, clear, not coke, not a watered down coke, but water.",,15
16119,16119,5814,9,"I don‚Äôt know what sick joke that was, bearing in mind I spent ¬£4 on delivery, my ¬£30 went to waste.",,21
16120,16120,5814,10,We‚Äôre vegetarian so we couldn‚Äôt eat the things we bought.,,10
16121,16121,5814,11,"To make matters worse I contacted uber eats, all they did was apologise and told me to rate my food so they know how to improve next time.",,28
16122,16122,5814,12,"Well there will be no next time, I‚Äôve fcked off to deliveroo, and they are treating me much better.",,19
16123,16123,5814,13,AVOID AVOID AVOID.,,3
16124,16124,5815,0,I had a delivery turn up nearly 2 hours late with missing items.,,13
16125,16125,5815,1,It was a McDonald‚Äôs or elder and 3 of the children had gone to bed as the food arrived after 9pm so it was wasted.,,25
16126,16126,5815,2,I immediately reported the issue on the app how apart from the automated response no one from Uber Eats responded to my multiple requests for a refund.,,27
16127,16127,5815,3,Due to the lack of acknowledgement or reply I reported it to PayPal who issued me with a refund.,,19
16128,16128,5815,4,Now my account is showing the refund as an outstanding amount due.,,12
16129,16129,5815,5,Again I reported it via the app and again got an automated response saying that because I received the refund via my payment provider I need to rectify the amount due myself and that I should have requested a refund via the app.,,43
16130,16130,5815,6,I have replied explaining that I did request a refund via the app numerous times but didn‚Äôt get any responses so 2 weeks later I reported it to PayPal.,,29
16131,16131,5815,7,Again I got an automated response of which I replied to check the messages I had sent previously but low and behold I have not had a response.,,28
16132,16132,5815,8,I won‚Äôt use Uber eats again disgusting levels of service or should I say no service!,,16
16133,16133,5816,0,I really can‚Äôt understand why I still use just eat for deliveries.,,12
16134,16134,5816,1,Sometimes they can be quick but they regularly lure you in with promises of 20-40 minute delivery and turn up after an hour or an hour and a half.,,29

16136,16136,5816,3,"They then put you through an 80 person queue (not exaggerating, this was the worst experience), then when you get in the top 10 the food arrives an hour and a half late.",,33
16137,16137,5816,4,"They do give you ¬£5 to spend at a later date to be fair to them but they really are consistent with poor time keeping and not by 5 minutes, the app will tell you the driver is in the restaurant for 40 minutes or much longer and I just can‚Äôt fathom why I have to be so lazy and keep using them.",,63
16138,16138,5816,5,I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was a one off but it‚Äôs happened 3 times out of about 7 or 8 with such severe lateness.,,24
16139,16139,5816,6,The last time I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to complain.,,9
16140,16140,5817,0,"My food was stone cold and had watched tracker to see delivery drive drop of another order while he had mine in the car yet my house is closer to kfc and the other order is in the opposite direction..it took longer to do the other delivery than for my order to come to me but after first drop off had twice the distance arrive to me and driver said Uber eats r the ones that tell him witch address to go to first even though he knew my address was closer..had to throw all the chips away and heat up the burgers witch wasn‚Äôt fantastic..this is I think the 2nd deliver I‚Äôve had by uber eats for kfc the first time I got some1 else‚Äôs order that I was left with and not enough food to go around my family so had to go to kfc to get what I actually ordered and even then the still gave me order with food missing and I was right in front of them and had to sort it out again but when using Uber eats for others..mac ds,Burger King ect I never have any problems...u need to sort your kfc out as all u do is give back delivery charge but I lose out on a lot of money that I‚Äôve paid on food...",,223

I‚Äôve ordered since this pandemic started.",,9
16142,16142,5818,1,Uber Eats messed me about let restaurants like KFC mess me about and let them take my money and not give me my food.,,24
16143,16143,5818,2,Today KFC took my money and didn‚Äôt give me my food and Uber let that happen didn‚Äôt refund me nor gave me my food- I had to starve for a whole day and I have severe medical condition.,,38
16144,16144,5818,3,"One time the driver stole my food, ran away with it and marked it as delivered.",,16
16145,16145,5818,4,Uber Eats was hesitant to refund me but when they investigated they found out that the driver ran away with our food- how bad is that especially in these uncertain times.,,31
16146,16146,5818,5,SHAME ON YOU UBER EATS!,,5
16147,16147,5818,6,There was this other restaurant that put a thick long hair in my cake and again Uber was hesitant to help.,,21

16150,16150,5818,9,They broke my heart!üò≠.,,4
16151,16151,5818,10,I pray what I‚Äôm Going through Uber Eats goes through it so they know how I feel with my medical condition and same goes to KFC.,,26
16152,16152,5818,11,What goes around comes around just remember that Uber Eats.,,10
16153,16153,5818,12,I‚Äôm going to also tell my friends and family to not order from them.,,14
16154,16154,5818,13,My worst experience EVER!,,4
16155,16155,5819,0,Where do I even start?,,5
16156,16156,5819,1,Ordered a large order from Burger King (first time in 15 years I‚Äôve been there).,,15
16157,16157,5819,2,Delivery was slow but given ongoing COVID restrictions this can be somewhat forgiven.,,13
16158,16158,5819,3,Driver gave me the incorrect order.,,6
16159,16159,5819,4,I tried to call the driver back before they had even left the street for which their response was ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù and continued driving.,,25
16160,16160,5819,5,"I then tried to contact Burger King, no one answered the phone and they are now closed.",,17
16161,16161,5819,6,Tried to then contact UberEats (44(0)8081785517) to be told I have no active order on my account and the service hangs up on you.,,24
16162,16162,5819,7,"If you 141 it, it similarly does the same and hangs up on you.",,14
16163,16163,5819,8,"Tried to them contact via the app, no response.",,9
16164,16164,5819,9,I‚Äôm now sat with two children‚Äôs meals that are 1/3rd the price of the total food we ordered both of which are stone cold.,,24
16165,16165,5819,10,I will NEVER make the mistake of using UberEats again.,,10
16166,16166,5819,11,What kind of companies response is ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù absolute joke and will be contacting my bank to receive a refund.,,21
16167,16167,5819,12,"Update:
UberEats have since rejected my request for a refund despite the food delivered having a receipt for around ¬£10 and my order coming to ¬£30 so I will now be taking this up directly with my bank.",,38
16168,16168,5819,13,Blatant theft from the worst company I‚Äôve ever dealt with.,,10
16169,16169,5819,14,"Save your time and money, don‚Äôt bother!",,7
16170,16170,5820,0,The app works really well and is easy to use with everything you need.,,14
16171,16171,5820,1,Totally put off of using just eats app again when I ordered food at 10:15am and by 11:15am I still hadn‚Äôt received anything but got a call from the driver telling me he had gone to the wrong house.,,39
16172,16172,5820,2,"He asked for my address which I told him and also text to him, he told me he would be right with me within the next 10mins.",,27
16173,16173,5820,3,30mins went by and still nothing.,,6
16174,16174,5820,4,"The tracker for the driver had stopped, the delivery was marked as delivered but I still hadn‚Äôt received my food.",,20
16175,16175,5820,5,"I decided to call the restaurant and question the issue, they told me I‚Äôd have to cal Just Eat themselves and make a complaint.",,24
16176,16176,5820,6,"After 15 mins of trying to get through I was simply told that my complaint had been logged, it will be sent to an investigation team and I will receive an email about an update to my complaint within the next 48 but in the meantime there‚Äôs nothing they can do.",,51
16177,16177,5820,7,So I waited a week for an email and nothing.,,10
16178,16178,5820,8,I called just eat and they said they can‚Äôt do anything but speak to the restaurant and I will have to wait for another email from their investigation team.,,29
16179,16179,5820,9,I‚Äôve been waiting 2 days for this email and still nothing.,,11
16180,16180,5820,10,Money down the drain and wasted time!,,7
16181,16181,5820,11,!,,1
16182,16182,5821,0,"I vowed never to use uber eats again last year and I‚Äôm pleased to say I‚Äôve followed through, and so has my entire household.",,24
16183,16183,5821,1,The customer service is atrocious.,,5
16184,16184,5821,2,McDonald‚Äôs delivery was the last thing tethering me to this horrendous company so I‚Äôm so glad that I can now get McDonald‚Äôs delivered for FREE elsewhere (as opposed to ¬£3.49 when the restaurant is literally 2 minutes down the road).,,40
16185,16185,5821,3,"Contrary to uber eats‚Äô website, the cost of delivery has nothing to do with the distance of the restaurant from your address.",,22
16186,16186,5821,4,The deals are fake.,,4
16187,16187,5821,5,"There have been multiple times where a deal was offered like free delivery for the next 5 minutes (funny how it always runs out no matter how quickly you try to order) or a 50% discount, but the discount is never applied at checkout.",,44
16188,16188,5821,6,The last time this happened I was just too tired to try to contact an actual human who wouldn‚Äôt be of any help anyway.,,24
16189,16189,5821,7,I also got tired of something always missing or wrong from almost every order and an uber eats representative actually saying to me ‚Äúthis is the last time we will refund you for a wrong order‚Äù... excuse me!?,,38
16190,16190,5821,8,"Things that I PAID FOR are missing from my order, but that‚Äôs somehow my fault?",,15
16191,16191,5821,9,That was the last straw for me.,,7
16192,16192,5821,10,My household has happily been using alternative services for nearly a year now.,,13
16193,16193,5821,11,Good luck to you if you try using uber eats.,,10
16194,16194,5822,0,Uber are an example to be wary of.,,8
16195,16195,5822,1,I‚Äôve now stopped using the platform as I‚Äôm sick of waiting for their underpaid multiapping drivers to turn up with my stone cold food.,,24
16196,16196,5822,2,It‚Äôs not worth it.,,4
16197,16197,5822,3,"If I‚Äôm paying ¬£4/5 delivery fee say to get a mcds from 1.1 miles away I expect it to be reasonabley fast , but definitely warm.",,26
16198,16198,5822,4,You take 20/30% off the restaurant and then take 25% service fee off the drivers you use.,,17
16199,16199,5822,5,I‚Äôve seen the scandalous amount you charge to what them poor souls do.,,13
16200,16200,5822,6,"I‚Äôve seen them sit in mcds for 20/30 minutes some nights, then they drive to the customer ASAP and get paid ¬£2.60!",,22
16201,16201,5822,7,"Whilst if it‚Äôs a ¬£30 order Uber make what ¬£6-¬£8 off mcds, ¬£5/¬£6 for the delivery and service fee off the customer, and the guys queuing in them horrendous places, running around getting parking tickets, talked to like scum, using their petrol get a whopping ¬£2.60!??",,46
16202,16202,5822,8,Your a disgrace of a company.,,6
16203,16203,5822,9,I‚Äôve started tipping the drivers now as I was unaware of how it worked but now I know I tip.,,20
16204,16204,5822,10,But that should be your place to pay them better then a tip is a bonus and not an absolute necessary.,,21
16205,16205,5822,11,And as for all you customers who don‚Äôt tip your driver‚Ä¶ trust me they remember you and you will receive poor service the next time they get you!,,28
16206,16206,5822,12,These guys talk.,,3
16207,16207,5822,13,If you‚Äôd gonna be a cheapskate customer don‚Äôt expect good service.,,11
16208,16208,5822,14,Start tipping and you are top of the list for these guys and you get prioritised.,,16
16209,16209,5823,0,Been using the app years.,,5
16210,16210,5823,1,Recently I‚Äôve had to ask for refunds or complain about missing items.,,12

16212,16212,5823,3,"Ordered at 6.30 for me and my kids, and it gave me 7.10 expected, latest 7:35, which was fine.",,19
16213,16213,5823,4,"My driver arrived at kfc around 7.10, which was fine, but he was sat outside kfc until 7.50!!",,18
16214,16214,5823,5,"It kept coming up saying that they had multiple orders, mien was ready but they were waiting on someone else.",,20
16215,16215,5823,6,"My food got here at 8, and it must of been sat in the car from 7.10 because I was soo cold!",,22
16216,16216,5823,7,"I tried applying for a refund as it was the worst I‚Äôd ever had, I had to send a picture and a comment - which I did.",,27
16217,16217,5823,8,"They tried to deny my refund, and they had no excuse, just that they wouldn‚Äôt do it.",,17
16218,16218,5823,9,"So I complained again, I was told I wasn‚Äôt entitled to a refund because I have more than one account, which they recon I used for a promotion.",,28
16219,16219,5823,10,"I explained my previous account was used 3 years ago and since then I‚Äôd had to set up a new account because of forgetting my details, and I‚Äôd been using my current account for nearly 2 years.",,37
16220,16220,5823,11,Also stated that I never had a promotion on the food.,,11
16221,16221,5823,12,Their reply was that they weren‚Äôt giving me a refund and that they were closing the complaint so they weren‚Äôt going to reply anymore.,,24
16222,16222,5823,13,"The joke is all the messages were automated, and not one meaningful apology for their mess.",,16
16223,16223,5823,14,I‚Äôve deleted the app now and won‚Äôt be using again.,,10
16224,16224,5824,0,I‚Äôm disappointed not only with the lack of professionalism from the delivery partner I had but also from the lack of care when it came to complaints.,,27
16225,16225,5824,1,My address doesn‚Äôt show up correctly on the Uber eats map despite entering it correctly and I made sure to write this in my extra notes so the driver would know.,,31
16226,16226,5824,2,Of course he didn‚Äôt read this and ended up on the next road.,,13
16227,16227,5824,3,I messaged and called to let him know he was at the wrong place and found he had dropped my food to the wrong house.,,25
16228,16228,5824,4,He then went to get the food back from the family that had taken it in thinking it was theirs and I had to be put on the phone with this family for them to explain the situation after hearing them argue with the delivery partner for a while.,,49
16229,16229,5824,5,I had agreed to take the food as long as it wasn‚Äôt opened and they confirmed it wasn‚Äôt.,,18
16230,16230,5824,6,My delivery partner then proceeded to go to another wrong address on the other end of the road despite me standing outside waving to him frantically.,,26
16231,16231,5824,7,I messaged and called and he then cancelled the order.,,10
16232,16232,5824,8,"When I tried to complain, Uber gave me an automated response saying the driver made reasonable effort to contact me but couldn‚Äôt which is an absolute lie as I have multiple phone calls to him in my phone history.",,39
16233,16233,5824,9,On my receipt it said they wouldn‚Äôt charge me but now I see they have so I not only didn‚Äôt get my food but I also lost money for someone else‚Äôs mistake.,,32
16234,16234,5824,10,Absolutely appalled and will not be recommending your services to anyone anymore.,,12
16235,16235,5825,0,I signed up for Uber eats to check out what food I could get but didn‚Äôt really use the app.,,20
16236,16236,5825,1,I kept getting promotion and deals on my email and keep getting to this date.,,15
16237,16237,5825,2,I decided to use the deal I had on my email but it didn‚Äôt work.,,15
16238,16238,5825,3,I also had deals on the app itself but again it didn‚Äôt work.,,13
16239,16239,5825,4,I kept getting ‚Äòerror‚Äô messages when trying to use it.,,10
16240,16240,5825,5,I messaged the customer service but I couldn‚Äôt wait for them to answer because I needed the food.,,18
16241,16241,5825,6,So My 3 discounts didn‚Äôt work and was wasted and I paid the full price so l overpaid ¬£15.,,19
16242,16242,5825,7,The agents said I was in breach of their policy because I had too many accounts.,,16
16243,16243,5825,8,I tried to explain to them that I only had one account under my name and email but they kept saying the same thing and would not listen to my side.,,31
16244,16244,5825,9,It doesn‚Äôt make any sense and they would not tell me what was the other account in question.,,18
16245,16245,5825,10,I tried to contact them by email and complain but didn‚Äôt get any answer.,,14
16246,16246,5825,11,This happened around 3 to 4 months ago.,,8
16247,16247,5825,12,Is it so wrong expecting to use a discount voucher that you have been issued and you are entitled to?,,20
16248,16248,5825,13,It is basically fake advertising.,,5
16249,16249,5825,14,I would like to explain to an agent what exactly happened and get my refund but I doubt it will happen.,,21
16250,16250,5825,15,Considering the poor customer service I already received.,,8
16251,16251,5825,16,So please reconsider before using this service or keep using this service.,,12
16252,16252,5825,17,"They will not bother to help you, they are only after money!",,12
16253,16253,5825,18,I recommend using Justeat which I been using for over a year and never had any problems.,,17
16254,16254,5825,19,They will honour the discounts.,,5
16255,16255,5826,0,"I‚Äôm in a similar boat to another user - I‚Äôve used Uber Eats for a few years now and I‚Äôve constantly been justifying the continuous order mistakes where restaurants either forget certain orders or items within it, drivers ‚Äòforget‚Äô to pick them up, or drivers apparently do pick them up and drive off in the opposite direction and I never see my order.",,63
16256,16256,5826,1,"Even more frustratingly, Uber Eats DOESN‚ÄôT communicate with the drivers and restaurants they support on their app, so when an order keeps getting delayed, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it until the driver finally claims it‚Äôs delivered or they actually deliver your food cold an hour after ordering it.",,50
16257,16257,5826,2,With the latter I contacted customer support yesterday only to receive standard email replies twice (both of them identical even when I explained what had happened!!!),,26
16258,16258,5826,3,"and then they replied a third time to state they wouldn‚Äôt give me a refund for the order at all and to just leave a negative review with the restaurant and driver, neglecting all responsibility on their part and still taking the money for inedible food.",,46
16259,16259,5826,4,So I‚Äôm leaving the negative review for Uber Eats itself and I‚Äôm telling all of you to avoid this app and company and to go with Just Eat or Deliveroo - much better customer service and orders are actually monitored and sorted out when there‚Äôs a delay.,,47
16260,16260,5826,5,I actually left a negative review with Uber Eats before almost two years ago and they suspended my account for several months before it suddenly allowed me in again to order through their app which is also unprofessional.,,38
16261,16261,5826,6,This company is a joke and I‚Äôm done defending it!,,10
16262,16262,5826,7,AVOID!,,1
16263,16263,5826,8,They don‚Äôt even deserve the one star rating but I have to in order to submit this review to warn others.,,21
16264,16264,5826,9,0/5 stars.,,2
16265,16265,5827,0,I ordered a McDonald‚Äôs via your Uber eats app.,,9
16266,16266,5827,1,When it was delivered items were missing.,,7
16267,16267,5827,2,I contacted the driver who told me that it was his issue and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the driver.,,17
16268,16268,5827,3,You need to go to McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù.,,6
16269,16269,5827,4,I have then driven to McDonald‚Äôs (kind of makes using your service redundant) only to be told by the manager that it wasn‚Äôt his problem and to contact Uber eats.,,30
16270,16270,5827,5,I have them had to repurchase the missing items even though I have already paid through the uber eats app.,,20
16271,16271,5827,6,The food quality was disgusting.,,5
16272,16272,5827,7,"And when looking at the bottom of the bags, sauces which had been paid for was still missing.",,18
16273,16273,5827,8,I appreciate that may not be an Uber eats issue.,,10
16274,16274,5827,9,I have then tried to rate my order and got offered a refund of ¬£2.99.,,15
16275,16275,5827,10,No chance to comment on quality of the rest of the food or complain about the quality of service from both your driver and McDonald‚Äôs.,,25
16276,16276,5827,11,All I get is a message saying the issue has been resolved.,,12
16277,16277,5827,12,I have then tried to complain through the ‚Äúdelivery partner‚Äù part of the app in to be told to rate his service.,,22
16278,16278,5827,13,Not only am I very disappointed with the driver and the quality of service but I am appalled by being told by the manager of McDonald‚Äôs that it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs issue‚Äù but Uber eats considering it was his restaurant and staff that is part to blame for this entire ordeal.,,50
16279,16279,5827,14,I may as well of driven to the restaurant myself rather than waste my time with this delivery service.,,19
16280,16280,5827,15,I may never use Uber eats or this particular McDonald‚Äôs restaurant again in the future as this is not the first time I have had issues.,,26
16281,16281,5827,16,I also think it‚Äôs disgusting that there is no email or phone number to contact with a complaint.,,18
16282,16282,5827,17,Complete joke of a company,,5
16283,16283,5828,0,Read all the bad reviews and you‚Äôll understand that ORDERING FOOD ON UBER EATS is just and invitation for disappointment.,,20
16284,16284,5828,1,They‚Äôre response and resolution are not there to serve the customers well instead the disgusting restaurants the mess up and send you gone off food/drink.,,25
16285,16285,5828,2,THEY ARE LITERALLY THE WORST!!!!,,5
16286,16286,5828,3,The customer service is a complete joke considering it such a big company.,,13
16287,16287,5828,4,Uber Eats are so incompetent and that seems to be an reoccurring problem within the company for many other customers.,,20
16288,16288,5828,5,Myself and my sister are NEVER using Uber eats again (or the 5 other family members that tasted what me and my sister ordered) especially after being given ¬£1.29 in credit for receiving GONE OFF MILKSHAKES from and an establishment called SENSATIONS (Dalston).,,43
16289,16289,5828,6,Why are you guys so ridiculous?,,6
16290,16290,5828,7,How are giving me ¬£1.29 ‚Äòcredit‚Äô for something that literally made me vomit????,,13
16291,16291,5828,8,"I asked the same person in the chat on how I can make a formal complaint and I got ignored, how disgusting!",,22
16292,16292,5828,9,I‚Äôm positive that your answer with just as shocking and pointless as your customer service!,,15
16293,16293,5828,10,HAVE YOU SEEN THE ANOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ON UBER EATS‚Äô facebook page?,,12
16294,16294,5828,11,Nearly EVERY single customer on there has complained about the nasty and useless customer service!,,15
16295,16295,5828,12,People‚Äôs accounts have been hacked with ¬£100s taken out and under eats isn‚Äôt even responding to them - GO READ THE COMMENTS.,,22
16296,16296,5828,13,It‚Äôs happened to several people.,,5
16297,16297,5828,14,"I‚Äôm not going to bother fighting over my money, but me and 6 others are definitely not coming back to Uber eats after yesterday night‚Äôs order.",,26
16298,16298,5828,15,All I want to do is let everyone else know that UBER EATS literally don‚Äôt care about you when your order will mess up or money will go missing out of your account.,,33
16299,16299,5828,16,They‚Äôll treat you with contempt .. they ARE PRACTICALLY THIEVES as there are plenty of people complaining that UBER EATS refuses to refund them for orders they‚Äôve never received!,,29
16300,16300,5828,17,My problem is minuscule compared to all the rest but it‚Äôs still the worst experience and who seriously would put themselves through stress caused by incompetent companies like UBER ????,,30
16301,16301,5828,18,I DON‚ÄôT even use their cars because there‚Äôs better companies that provide amazing customer service!!!,,15
16302,16302,5828,19,WONT EVER USE THESE THIEVES!!,,5

16304,16304,5829,0,My dad bought his first order from here which was about ¬£40.,,12
16305,16305,5829,1,However the app is rigged and the delivery address would either show the wrong door number or the wrong post code.,,21
16306,16306,5829,2,That‚Äôs why I never ordered from this app.,,8
16307,16307,5829,3,"But my dad did yesterday and he put the wrong address, he realised he put the wrong address after ordering the food so he called the driver and told him our actual address.",,33
16308,16308,5829,4,The delivery guy told us he would contact us later and bring the food.,,14
16309,16309,5829,5,And surprise surprise‚Ä¶ he never did.,,6
16310,16310,5829,6,So the app took the ¬£40 and the food and when we asked for a refund the reply was like ‚Äúthe driver waited 20 minutes at the address so the refund cannot be done‚Äù.,,34
16311,16311,5829,7,The customer service people did not even hear out our side of the story and refused to give us the refund of ¬£40.,,23
16312,16312,5829,8,Keep in mind we earn below average and ¬£40 is not a little amount for us.,,16
16313,16313,5829,9,I contacted them again explaining our story but they never responded and my dad keep glaring at me because apparently it‚Äôs my fault the app is rigged and doesn‚Äôt let us put our actual correct address and HE made the damn order.,,42
16314,16314,5829,10,And yesterday was my mother‚Äôs birthday and we were planning on celebrating with Turkish food.,,15
16315,16315,5829,11,Not only did we wait for the whole night but mum had to make dinner after she realised the food wasn‚Äôt coming and she came back from work so I didn‚Äôt want her to make food and I wanted her to relax.,,42
16316,16316,5829,12,But since I can‚Äôt cook and it was pretty late we just ate a sandwich.,,15
16317,16317,5829,13,First time and last time I‚Äôm ordering anything off this stupid app.,,12
16318,16318,5829,14,Both my parents are putting the blame on me because I didn‚Äôt order instead of dad but the main thing at fault is the app with the broken delivery address thing.,,31
16319,16319,5829,15,I‚Äôve always had a bad relationship with my parents and now they hate me even more after losing ¬£40.,,19
16320,16320,5829,16,"I hate both my parents and the Uber eats app ‚ù§Ô∏è

After so many emails they finally gave the refund.",,21
16321,16321,5829,17,Still not impressed that I had to send them a bunch of emails to give me a simple refund.,,19
16322,16322,5830,0,"I have used this app for over a year on my current phone (iphone 7s, fully updated..) 
I have no issue at all with service or anything else except that having not used the app in a while due to having moved I went to use it tonight, I was presented with an update option for the app which I immediately tapped to update and was told I have to have iOS 13 for this to work my latest iPhone update is iOS 12.5 or something or other (updated 2 days ago by the way) meaning that my iPhone can no longer access this app, which it did PERFECTLY WELL NOT 4 MONTHS AGO!",,114
16323,16323,5830,1,Now looking at the app description on the App Store and it CLEARLY STATES THIS APP WORKS ON THIS IPHONE!!,,20
16324,16324,5830,2,Yet it clearly does not.. I‚Äôm more than a bit annoyed (as the title suggests^^) and was looking forward to a takeaway this evening after work now with all the messing about I‚Äôve had to do to find out why the app don‚Äôt work I‚Äôve now MISSED the takeaway etc and am still stuck with a useless app that won‚Äôt run on my device and am now wondering if this is some sort of ploy by APPLE AND APP DEVELOPERS to force people into buying the latest device‚Äôs and if I‚Äôm right that‚Äôs an absolutely abhorrent consumer marketing ploy by apple and the app developers of this app... if you want me to continue using your app as I have done for quite some time and regularly then reinstate the previous update that worked on my phone or I will be choosing a different app entirely.. and when this iPhone of mine breaks (and believe me it wont be a long time before it does..) I‚Äôll be seriously questioning apple as the maker of my next smartphone purchase..,,178
16325,16325,5830,3,I bought my handset brand new at a price of nearly ¬£1000 from apples own website and have noticed in the last several months many of my daily use apps are starting to require updates that are no longer issues for my device... if this continues I will choose a handset that does not have this ‚Äúforced upgrade‚Äù issue and it WILL NOT be an iPhone... maybe a Samsung or perhaps a Nokia.. DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO!!!!!!!,,82

16329,16329,5831,2,"Customer service lying to my face, making me wait for extra hour only to tell me in the end at 23:40 pm that I‚Äôm not receiving my food, and I need to wait 48 hours to be contacted by someone to sort out my problem‚Ä¶ I have been told few times to change my phone number and email in the App but your App does not offer such options‚Ä¶ You have made me feel like a criminal and a lier.",,80
16330,16330,5831,3,"Two weeks ago one of your drivers, called the number register on this account (my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs number) and tried to convince her to go out with him for dinner.",,29
16331,16331,5831,4,"At one point I came to the door, cause I heard him speaking outside so he hanged up the phone and told me ‚ÄúI was just flirting on the phone with this girl, who is she?‚Äù I felt very uncomfortable.",,40
16332,16332,5831,5,"I told him it was my old number, I didn‚Äôt know who was it, so he insisted I should change my number and asked me what‚Äôs the correct one.",,29
16333,16333,5831,6,"I told him my number, assuming he can change it, or put it on record, but instead I got a private message from him in What‚ÄôsApp 2 hours later, says something like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up, it‚Äôs the delivery boy‚Äù
Then one week ago I ordered food, it never arrived.",,48
16334,16334,5831,7,I called Mi Sushi to find out what‚Äôs happening and at First I was told by the Super that the delivery driver was send away by someone in my house.,,30
16335,16335,5831,8,"When I challenged that, insisting that I was waiting next to the door in my kitchen for 1 hour, he changed his version and told me that my number was wrong and when they called me someone told them to go away.",,42
16336,16336,5831,9,"When I challenged that, telling them it was my ex-girlfriend and all she told them was, that she wasn‚Äôt the person who ordered, he changed his version Again and told me that the driver thought that this was a Prank-order, so he left with my food.",,46
16337,16337,5831,10,"I insisted that the drivers are supposed to come to the door at the address no matter the phone call, and he never did, and that the order was paid for so there is no logic in being a Prank?",,40
16338,16338,5831,11,"To this he insisted that it was my fault for not changing my number (even thought I do not have such options in the App), that his driver was a trustworthy guy and he believed him over me, also he said that my food was already discarded and the kitchen was closed so he couldn‚Äôt help me.",,57
16339,16339,5831,12,I asked for refund so he directed me to Just Eat customer service.,,13
16340,16340,5831,13,"I wasn‚Äôt given an option to talk to anyone just to text to a bot and after a very frustrating 40 min texting back and forward, I was forced to agree to half a refund because the restaurant needed the other half.",,42

16343,16343,5831,16,"At 22:30 I‚Äôm calling in to check where my food at, the restaurant is not responding, on their website says they are closed.",,23
16344,16344,5831,17,"I‚Äôm calling Just Eat, and a customer service advisor ‚Äúchecks‚Äù my order and lies to me that the order will actually arrive at 23:00, I‚Äôve asked her few times whether she was sure about it cause it looks like they are already closed.",,43
16345,16345,5831,18,She assured me I‚Äôm getting my food and she said she was transferring ¬£5 credit to my account for the wait.,,21
