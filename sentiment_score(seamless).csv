2449,"I recently moved in to Brooklyn, NY. As you all must know or have heard about, this great city has a massive traffic problem. Traveling in a motor vehicle is horrendously slow. I have truly averaged a 15 min mile pace at times. Due to this I was confined to the restaraunts remotely close to me because I would also melt on my leisurely walks to further restaraunts due to this unrelenting and unforgivable summer heat.  One day while drinking myself into a stupor at one of my favorite neighborhood watering holes, I overheard a velumptious blond woman saying she uses seamless all the time to order her food to the door. I immediately pulled out my phone and downloaded the app. I swore I would order my next days hangover meal using seamless to give it a shot.  I was astounded at the simplicity, options and functionality of this app. Whoever created it deserves a hug and a year supply of there favorite alcoholic beverage delivered on horseback straight to their door. I would like to personally thank him/her/them for creating such a wonderful app. They are the kind of people I would like to have at my wedding, true pioneers of the new app era we currently live in.  As I am currently overwhelmed with my medical studies, this app is the perfect tool to help nourish my bodies need for food without cutting into my study time. This directly adds more study time that I would normally lose shopping or personally going to get myself food. Since there is a positive correlation with study time invested and medical knowledge; this app has helped my brain learn more medical knowledge, therefore making me a better junior physician.   You are saving lives Seamless... saving lives.  Thank you for your existence, hope to see you at my future wedding/graduation from medical school (next year in May!)

5586,Hi. Seamless is owned by GrubHub. Basically your dealing with GrubHub delivery drivers. The problem with delayed or cold or cancelled deliveries is because GrubHub/seamless pays drivers $2 +$mileage ( $0.25 per mile) +$ tip. Now if the jobs is going 5 Miles and you tipped $2 well that's $6 let's say with mileage. After tax and maintenance gas insurance driver not making money . So basically drivers only taking the big tippers.

5786,"Great intuitive interface and convenient. The customer service was friendly and quick to respond. The problem I had was with their inability to inform customers that they cant deliver your food because no one is available in your area to deliver. So if your in a small out of the way town like Queens New York on Christmas day, don't expect to have your order be delivered. You will find out there is an issue only when you go out of your way and call. Even then, you might only end up with a 10% coupon. Never had an issue before and used the app maybe twice a week for about 5 months but I am going to try another service. If you're bored and interested in learning about my adventure, then here it is. Its Christmas day and had to work but didn't bring lunch. I didn't feel like driving and searching for a place that was open and went to Seamless. I found a place and ordered some Nachos and a Chicken Burrito because nothing says Christmas like Nachos and a burrito. I ordered at 12:50 and expected the food to show up in about 40m - 1h and go back to work. I get a notification that there will be a delayed delivery. The new estimated time is after 2:00. I start to get hungry around 2:30 and check the app to find that it says the delivery time has been moved to 2:45. I survived until now so whats 15m to me, so I go back to work. At 2:45 I check the app to see that the delivery time is now 3:10. I call the restaurant and they told me that the food was ready within 20m of the order and it has just been sitting there for at least an hour. No one from grubhub/seamless has came by to pick it up. I talk to the seamless team via their chat service and they tell me that she will be investigating. Within 6 min, they have found a driver and I should be expecting my food within 15min. So I thought everything was OK. I got a coupon for 10% off and hopefully warm meal. As soon as the chat was over, I also get a call from a real live human being telling me that they confirmed that a driver is picking up the food and an apology for the delay. I thought that was nice of them to reach out and let me know. I then get an email as soon as I hang up saying that the order was canceled which I thought was odd but I assumed it was their way of just refunding me the cost of the order and giving me a free meal. So I'm getting a free meal that's hopefully warm and a 10% code. So I wait the 15m with no delivery. Then I wait for another 15m just in case it took them longer to get to my place then expected and nothing. So now its its maybe 3:40 and I have no food, I'm hungry, and all I have is a coupon for 10% off my next order. I cant even gift it to someone. Its paired to my account. Well now I have time to get something to eat and leave my house, get in my car, and drive through town to find a place that is open. I ended up eating at 4pm. If you have a low supply of people in an area on a day and your clients could expect delays on delivery or no delivery at all, why not let people know so they can make other plans. If a delivery has been pushed back up to 3 times due to being unable to find someone to deliver, have someone investigate. Is there even a mechanism on your end to contact clients that appear to have delivery problems? There was only one notification letting me know there was a change. Could there have been changes up to the point where the place close? If food will be sitting on the shelf for more that 30m, Have the place remake the food at your expense since you could not find someone to deliver the food. I dont want to even thing about whats done when ice cream is ordered through your service. If you call someone and tell them its on the way and within seconds of them hanging up, you cancel the order, let them know not the expect a delivery. Can delivery issues happen with any other service? Yes, But would a customer have to find out over 3 hours after an order was made that they will not be getting anything to eat? I have no idea.",1,great intuitive interface convenient customer service friendly quick respond problem inability inform customers cant deliver food one available area deliver small way town like

Ever since they merged and the logos and apps became identical the service disintegrated and the prices keep rising. The common promotions slowly disappeared and when they do come they appear via push service only. If you don't immediately order or take a screenshot of the code it disappears for good. Here's the best part: the offer says $5 off a $10+ order, for example, but when you try to order the minimum is actually $30. This happened to me two days in a row. Other times, the code simply didn't work, no reason given. If you have the patience to argue back and forth with Grubhub (which can only be done via Twitter now) you'll eventually miss the delivery window anyway.

1,"Seamless is truly the worst food delivery app out there. I do not understand how this company is still in business. I've given this app multiple chances and every single time that I use it, something goes wrong - whether it's taking two hours instead of 45 minutes to deliver (this has happened every time I've ordered) or in the most recent instance where they literally cancelled my order 10 minutes after it was supposed to be delivered. That last experience was the most absurd situation I've experienced when it comes to food delivery apps - there was no apology or explanation it was just a note that my order had been cancelled and when I called customer service they could not have been less helpful. There are so many other and better options out there - stay clear of this one.

The few times I’ve had issues were resolved quickly by Seamless over the phone with a refund and credit/discounts for future orders. They were usually because the vendor at the store/restaurant made an error. I choose Seamless even when I have the menu and info to order directly to vendors because I don’t want to have to talk to people on a phone to get food. I just want to order it by tapping a few options and getting it to me ASAP (which in midtown Manhattan for me is 20-45min).

When inquired, Seamless responded “we don’t see a large enough order from This area so we are no longer delivering food to this area.”  Now, according to these restaurants they still order to our address. 
Secondly, when food is ordered, addressed needs to be re-entered and I️t says food can of be ordered because it’s out of delivery area.  When inquired, seamless suggested that we use the web GUI.  Right, instead of fixing the problem or apologizing, try the website.  

There are plenty other food delivery services that can be used in NYC. Guess we don’t see a reason to continue supporting Seamless although we continued supporting using their services after they hiked up their “delivery” fee just as soon as they took over the delivery from the local restaurants.",1,seamless used go app sadly services app update really made food ordering difficult first many restaurants able order longer available inquired seamless responded see large enough order area longer delivering food area according restaurants still order address secondly food ordered addressed needs entered says food ordered delivery area inquired seamless suggested use web gui right instead fixing problem apologizing try website plenty food delivery services used nyc guess see reason continue supporting seamless although continued supporting using services hiked delivery fee soon took delivery local restaurants,Negative,-0.7322,seamless used go app sadly service app update really made food ordering difficult first many restaurant able order longer available inquired seamless responded see large enough order area longer delivering food area according restaurant still order address secondly food ordered addressed need entered say food ordered delivery area inquired seamless suggested use web gui right instead fixing problem apologizing try website plenty food delivery service used nyc guess see reason continue supporting seamless although continued supporting using service hiked delivery fee soon took delivery local restaurant,seamless use go app sadli servic app updat realli made food order difficult first mani restaur abl order longer avail inquir seamless respond see larg enough order area longer deliv food area accord restaur still order address secondli food order address need enter say food order deliveri area inquir seamless suggest use web gui right instead fix problem apolog tri websit plenti food deliveri servic use nyc guess see reason continu support seamless although continu support use servic hike deliveri fee soon took deliveri local restaur
4,"Seamless is an extremely streamlined and accessible app that shows you hundreds of restaurants in your neighborhood and even some you might not know about. In most cases it works very well and even when it doesn’t the customer support is top notch with short wait times and support representatives who know what they are doing and know the solution to most, if not all, problems. One system, however, is by far the most baffling one I’ve ever seen; When a restaurant doesn’t have its own staff for delivery, seamless will send it’s own drivers to pick it up and deliver it to you. The problem is that seamless gives the restaurant no way to identify a driver besides the driver saying so. This can lead to smart thieves walking into restaurants with the seamless logo on the window and walking out with your food because they claimed to be drivers. This is a huge oversight and I’ve gotten food stolen from me already.

This is a story about mediocre customer service. And remember: I’m just ordering take-out Chinese food. Seamless is attempting to take something that is already trivially easy and make it easier. But then this happens.

Placed our order at 10:01pm, 30-40 minute delivery. At 10:55pm I called the restaurant for an update. I was told only the manager handled online orders, and would have to call me back. Someone called back at 10:58pm to say my order was on its way. Tried calling again at 11:27pm, but no answer. Called Seamless at 11:28pm. Was told that they wouldn’t issue a refund until they spoke with the restaurant — which was now closed. Was also told that the food was delivered at 10:55pm, three minutes before the manager called me to tell me it was out for delivery. Seamless was not able to reach the restaurant, as expected. Despite the fact that I specifically asked Seamless to call me back with the update, they managed to go straight to voicemail. I tweeted Seamless with my frustration and complaint. They reconfirmed all of this, and said they would issue a refund immediately “as a one time courtesy”, and made it very clear that they don’t trust “claims” until they speak to the restaurant.

As of 1:00am — hours after the restaurant closed — the Seamless app still reported that my order was out for delivery.

Seamless took a frustrating delivery experience and turned it into an angering, insulting mess, holding me and my money hostage. They made it clear that issuing refunds promptly and without a complicated discussion across multiple channels is something they consider a “one time courtesy”. Having spent a lot of money over the years with Seamless, without issue, this is insulting. I should have just ordered from the restaurant over the phone and avoided all of this, except the missed delivery. At least then the only thing I would be missing would be my food.

on its face.

PROs
I love the quick ordering, express reorder, the fact that I can handle gratuity in the app - all works well. Support has been excellent the few times I needed it. Choice of restaurants is pretty decent.  Ability to search for a specific food item, filter by a number of different metadata elements, all add to convenience.

CONS
Choice of restaurant is decent but incomplete in my neighborhood - some number of places aren’t in seamless yet. I also live on a neighborhood boundary which confuses the app; it will let me order from places that won’t deliver to me, and refuses to take orders from places that do, which means I have to call them.   Final con: the delivery estimates are absolute garbage. I’ve almost never had one come close, and the app does not provide updates.

459,"This is a fantastic app, which makes ordering food convenient. My only criticism is that it calculates tip with tax included. As someone who has worked in food service, it is not customary to tip on tax. Tax is not part of the service. Not to mention, if a delivery fee is included, its there to compensate the delivery person.

648,"Expect to pay more for delivery compared to every food delivery app out there, for the same exact service. 

*Please refer to my first review experience review below for more information. The restaurants name is irrelevant as I expect many other restaurants ""provide their own drivers"" as well*

Two reasons why this was my first seamless order and last. 

First, I didn't eat dinner last night (thanks to this restaurant). I decided to try a new service that claimed to provide a easy stress-free ""no-human"" service. I guess I did get a ""no-human"" service because my food never came. After first calling the restaurant asking about my orders status, I was told I would have to wait only 10 minutes longer passed my estimated delivery time, no problem. Only this was a horrible lie as I waited another 30 before I called customer service for an updated ETA for just 20 minutes longer, ""fine I can wait"" I thought, until a total two hours after my initial order (which was placed when I was already feeling hungry as many of your customers probably do). Finally I decided to cancel my order and go to sleep hungry because any buisness that lies to its customers especially *hungry paying customers* does not deserve my, or anyone else's, buisness. (Edit: This was 2 hours after my order was placed, and still no update after the initial ""the restaurant is now preparing your order"" status)

Second, Seamless charges a $9 delivery fee for this restaurant, I assumed that meant I would get a service that reflects that price *especially since the SAME delivery order can be made on yelp with a $2 delivery charge*. Unfortunately this premium delivery price comes with the exact same quality service as the $2 ,or even free, delivery option. When I initially asked Seamless customer service why my order had *no* status update 40 minutes after my order confirmation (which was my estimated delivery wait time) I was told that this restaurant provides their own driver...

This is more insulting than a seamless delivery driver being late because this means *there is no difference your service provides from any other* I might as well call the buisness myself, pay less of a delivery charge, and get the same horrible service this restaurant provides. 

If your restaurants provide their own drivers, you must hold them to the standards you'd for your own drivers. Read the reviews, this isn't uncommon with this restaurant.

I liked that i could see the physical distance - how many miles each restaurant is away on the screen with all of the choices, i could see the delivery minimum fee on each restaurant with all of the choices, in NYC they might say delivery time of 20 min but if its a mile away its not real. You took all the tools away. And now i cant see distance or delivery minimums as i am scrolling. I dont need it sorted by distance from me - because i dont know with 300 delivery restaurants if i am after a few scrolls then looking at something over a mile away - there are no cars , its not smart to get cold food here!  This is a hassle clicking on each restaurant to see what the distance (not delivery time) is and the delivery minimum fee is to decide. 

I hate these changes.  Also you need to let the filter apply more than one fliter at a time. And change the word delivery fee to NO delivery fee in the filter.

919,"Tonight was my first experience using Seamless— and let me tell you, it was anything but. We placed an order at 6:30pm, was told it would be delivered between 7:15-7:30pm. At 7:30, I had not received any update on the order status, so I called the restaurant, who said they just then received my order. They assured me the food would be out of their hands within 20 minutes. Another 45 minutes later I called back and was told that a driver had come and left but did not take my order, which was ready. Finally after a very long hold I got through to Seamless customer service. The agent was polite and told us that our order would arrive in 7 minutes. It did not. We have no way of contacting the driver, and when we asked for a way to contact them, they told us we had to call Seamless’ customer service line again (which means another 5-10 minutes waiting on hold for an agent to pick up). While I was on hold my Seamless app finally updated my eta to 9:03-9:13pm and said the delivery biker was on the way. So the food was ready around 7:45pm and still wouldn’t get to me until and hour and a half after it was made- meaning it would be cold by the time I received it.

All in all, it took over 2 hours for this order to be delivered, without any updates from Seamless about any issues (my ETA even read 7:42-7:52 after 8pm had come and gone). I find this very unprofessional on Seamless’s part- if there are ongoing issues with communication to the restaurant or with delivery I should not have to seek out answers and updates on my order. And Seamless offered nothing but a half-hearted apology for our trouble. When I finally asked if a reimbursement was possible they offered a promo code to use on my next order.

1203,"The usability on this app can be frustrating at times. Firstly I like the past orders section. However if I press on the name of restaurant it should bring me to the menu not to the last order I made. If I tap on the white card with the order details, then sure show me the last order I made. The expectation is that if I click on the name, I want to order something different from that restaurant. 
The other use case is viewing the status of my order. I have no idea how to do this. It was not appearing under My Seamless. If I tap on the gear icon I also don’t see anything related. Eventually I had to rely on my email to figure out the status. Loading into the app now I see that “Your Order has been picked up” but I never saw any intermediate status (order received, order in the works, etc). 
Additionally when I switched from delivery to pickup option, the tip section was impossible to toggle off without starting the whole process over. 
Lastly, the Restaurant tab times out so often it’s frustrating to click on. However as this could be due to a number of factors that are beyond developer control like poor connectivity, I mention it last.

1328,"After having seen my friends and my husband have some terrible experiences with DoorDash and UberEats over the past few months, I just wanted to leave a review here because every time I was thinking “this would never happen with Seamless”. 

Despite whatever minor complaints people leave on here (most of the ones I just read sound like a user issue, not a system issue imo), I believe Seamless is still the best app out there for food delivery, and one with the best customer service. 

I’ve been using it for over 6 years now, in 2 different cities, for delivery to 9 different addresses. The only 2 times I remember having an issue where the restaurant did not deliver or canceled my order, Seamless customer service reached out to me proactively over the phone and email before I even had a chance to reach out to them, and handled the issue in the most appropriate and considerate way imaginable. Which I’ll admit I was probably taking for granted until the above-mentioned bad experiences with other providers.

Bottom line is that I always feel like I can call and talk to a live person at Seamless if I ever have an issue (although I never really do or need to) who will want to help me, AND I can actually call the restaurant directly, and they will treat me as their customer. With the other apps, it’s become apparent that their customer service is nearly impossible to reach and then just read from a script like a robot not listening to what you’re actually saying, and if you try to call the restaurant, they refuse to deal with you because they consider the delivery person to be their customer because that’s who pays them directly. 

The app itself is great and so easy to use, and its features and functionality have been improving over the years. But one thing I would suggest for future updates would be the ability to rate and/or review individual menu items and/or post pictures with reviews because sometimes I feel like I need to go to Yelp to figure out what to order. Or just buy Yelp lol.",5,seen friends husband terrible experiences doordash ubereats past months wanted leave review every time thinking would never happen seamless despite whatever minor complaints people leave ones read sound like user issue system issue imo believe seamless still best app food delivery one best customer service using years different cities delivery different addresses times remember issue restaurant deliver canceled order seamless customer service reached proactively phone email even chance reach handled issue appropriate considerate way imaginable admit probably taking granted mentioned bad experiences providers bottom line always feel like call talk live person seamless ever issue although never really need want help actually call restaurant directly treat customer apps become apparent customer service nearly impossible reach read script like robot listening actually saying try call restaurant refuse deal consider delivery person customer pays directly app great easy use features functionality improving years one thing would suggest future updates would ability rate review individual menu items post pictures reviews sometimes feel like need go yelp figure order buy yelp lol,Positive,0.9801,seen friend husband terrible experience doordash ubereats past month wanted leave review every time thinking would never happen seamless despite whatever minor complaint people leave one read sound like user issue system issue imo believe seamless still best app food delivery one best customer service using year different city delivery different address time remember issue restaurant deliver canceled order seamless customer service reached proactively phone email even chance reach handled issue appropriate considerate way imaginable admit probably taking granted mentioned bad experience provider bottom line always feel like call talk live person seamless ever issue although never really need want help actually call restaurant directly treat customer apps become apparent customer service nearly impossible reach read script like robot listening actually saying try call restaurant refuse deal consider delivery person customer pay directly app great easy use feature functionality improving year one thing would suggest future update would ability rate review individual menu item post picture review sometimes feel like need go yelp figure order buy yelp lol,seen friend husband terribl experi doordash ubereat past month want leav review everi time think would never happen seamless despit whatev minor complaint peopl leav one read sound like user issu system issu imo believ seamless still best app food deliveri one best custom servic use year differ citi deliveri differ address time rememb issu restaur deliv cancel order seamless custom servic reach proactiv phone email even chanc reach handl issu appropri consider way imagin admit probabl take grant mention bad experi provid bottom line alway feel like call talk live person seamless ever issu although never realli need want help actual call restaur directli treat custom app becom appar custom servic nearli imposs reach read script like robot listen actual say tri call restaur refus deal consid deliveri person custom pay directli app great easi use featur function improv year one thing would suggest futur updat would abil rate review individu menu item post pictur review sometim feel like need go yelp figur order buy yelp lol

1432,"This app is a joke. When I ordered my food it gave me a time frame of delivery. That time came and went and they kept adding time. After an hour I went down and picked up my cold, soggy food myself. When I contacted customer service I was put on trial — and was told that I had to “prove it to them.” I spoke with 4 reps over the phone and chat and nobody helped me. They kept to their scripts. So not only did they lie about and charge me for delivery, I had to pay for cold inedible food. As a tech marketing director myself,  it’s pathetic to me how much money this company spends on NYC advertising to gain new customers but spends zero dollars on retaining their existing customers.

1528,"Recent updates have really tanked the user experience. One, they got rid of menu categories. Try ordering from an NYC diner without it — ridiculous. Two, they removed delivery fee info from the main menu page so that you don’t see it until you’re about to check out and get hit with a $7.99 delivery charge — shady. At bare minimum they could put it in the restaurant’s About Info so that you don’t have to add a fake item and then go to your cart just to see how much the fee is.  

These changes clearly weren’t made with the user in mind, so I’m guessing they thought they’d please restaurant owners by forcing users to spend more time looking at their menus and not ruling a place out based on how high the fee is. Instead it makes me more inclined to reorder from places I already know (or not order at all) and creates frustration that spills over from Seamless onto the restaurant, which is ultimately bad for their business, not just for Seamless.

1533,"I’m done with Grubhub/ Seamless. I’ve been moving over to Postmates/ Caviar for the last year and the experience I just had with their customer service representative just made me move 100% in that direction. 

1) there was a service fee on the delivery, which arrived over an hour later than I was told; this did not get refunded. They offered me “store credit” of $5 (this was a fifty dollar order...) instead, which, uh, I’m not going to use. 
2) my food arrived literally ice cold - no offer of compensation on this. I tipped 20%. Again- outside of the $5 offer above, no offer of compensation. 20% of $50 is ten dollars. Which is what I paid for my food to arrive cold. 
3) my food arrived MISSING ITEMS. The restaurant I ordered from always has a side with their sandwiches, no side. And then there’s the side I paid for - the only offer I got for a refund here was on the price of the item, not including tax/ tip/ service fee. And no partial refund for the missing included side?
4) the customer service rep was super rude - they didn’t offer anything aside from the $5 credit and the refunded item, and then kept putting me on hold just for the restaurant themselves to call me with info on my refund. If Seamless doesn’t do any of this on my end, why use them as a vendor?! There are better options out there.

Imagine receiving a notification from seamless that there is a concern about your order “Driver couldn’t reach you.” This is laughable because the driver never tried calling you to tell you he arrived or left. 

You remember Seamless providing the ability in the past to request refunds/indicate an issue with your order or chat via text with a rep. Not anymore. 

You call seamless/grubhub, stay on the line for 30 minutes watching your lunch hour tick away, only to first be told your driver is there (false). Then, after holding for much longer, you’re told the driver is on his next delivery already. But you’ve run out of time to eat (much less wait longer for the driver to come back), and so now you just want to cancel your order. The rep insists he cannot refund your order but will give you 50% off your next one. Good job taking my money and running.

1739,"My usage with Seamless has gone down tremendously. Their system does not allow you to update your primary contact information according to the customer service representative I spoke to. Even if you do, it doesn’t register on their end. I changed my phone number a few months ago and even though my old number was deleted and updated, every time I order from a restaurant, they still have my old number on the order receipt. The delivery person is forced to contact seamless, who then has to alert me via email (the delivery people never look at the delivery instructions to ring the buzzer for some reason).

1830,"My partner is currently on dialysis so these delivery apps are great at times but TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE plays a really big part when using these delivery services but they all come with limitations. After placing many orders and having our food consistently and constantly incorrect. I decided to browse the App Store to see if there were any other delivery apps that serviced my areas with different options. I came across “Seamless” downloaded the app to give it a try. Once download was complete, I opened the app and right off hand I noticed the interface seemed very familiar. I proceeded to setup an account and unbeknownst to me my information was pre-populated. I felt it was my phone that may have pre-filled in all my information. I didn’t think anything about it. I was offered a discount with my first order. After placing everything in my cart I went to check-out and given a discount code to use once my order was complete. I tried to use the code but the code was invalid. Reasoning: “This code is valid for first time users only” as I was so confused by that message. I decided to chat with customer service within the app. Upon chatting with the customer service rep I was immediately reprimanded for trying to cheat the system. I was told I already have account. I informed the rep I have never used this app before, their response was, you have a “GRUB-HUB” account. I was shocked but not surprised. That’s something common in the U.S., companies are allowed to have multiple subsidiaries. It’s sad but hey, there is nothing you can do about it. Just be warned, “Seamless” is grubhub. In my case they have the same options with the same prices, fees, and incompetent delivery drivers. The old school customer service is gone. There isn’t one company that have workers that’s welling to go “above and beyond” any longer. One or ten bad experiences will no longer break a company, it’s enough people in this country that will keep a company afloat. SAD BUT TRUE. I no longer use any of these apps.

You used to even be able to sort your delivery options by fee, but they’ve removed that that functionality. The fees are non-trivial- in Upper Manhattan, plenty of places have $8-10 fees, which add up. 

This is on top of service fees, and the tip- which they have somehow managed to screw up as well. The mobile app shows a different array of preset percentage options than the desktop site at this point, and while I support tipping well, having 25% be the default tip on the mobile app (on top of all these other hidden fees) is really offensive. 

There are other decent food delivery apps emerging as alternatives, and whenever possible, I’m using those now. Seamless is patently anti-consumer. For many years, I ordered from them at least 5x a week, and the only coupons or rewards I’ve seen showed up when Amazon Restaurants (which is now defunct) made a big push into NY.

2136,"I’ve used Seamless for over a year now very consistently (with work keeping me out late and sometimes too tired to cook). It’s been pretty helpful and good for me to be able to eat no matter what because I’ve struggled with that I’m the past.

That said, I had a terrible experience where food didn’t arrive at my apartment almost 3 hours after the I placed the order, from a restaurant only a mile away. I called after the order was an hour and a half late and the owner told me no drivers were available (which means the order should never have been accepted in my opinion). But he told me he would get it to me so I waited. It came while I was already in bed about to go to sleep having given up on the order. 

So I called customer support the next day and after being out on hold for 16 minutes I was hung up on with no follow up. The next call I made I was told I would receive a 20% discount for my next order, which to me might have been okay if it weren’t for the fact that I was given the run-around by the first agent. I asked for a refund and they said there was no way in the system to give me a refund for a late order. This second conversation lasted 14 minutes. Just to be told nothing could be done basically. 

Really left a bad taste in my mouth, so I won’t be using Seamless again.

2137,I don’t know if my last review went through but I need people to know this app has gone downhill. I’ve been using it for years and my last few orders have had delivery problems. I know it’s not with the restaurants because I call the restaurants and they say drivers either don’t come or they take the food. I ordered food earlier today and it never came. I called the restaurant and they told me the driver that came to get my food and another person is all of a sudden MIA. They told me to call seamless and told me they told the other guy to do the same. I call Seamless to get it resolved and they said the guy called me a couple of times (never got those calls btw) so they would only offer me 50% off my next order and not a refund. When I called the restaurant they said Seamless told the other guy the same thing. I essentially just paid $25 for Seamless to waste my time. This happened before and I ended up having to walk to the restaurant to get my food which kinda defeats the purpose of a delivery app. Screw this app. I’d rather pay the delivery fees from better apps and actually get my food than use Seamless again. You can keep your 50% off.

Each one lied, as when I called back hour after hour each agent told me the delivery guy was either there or—in the case of my last call—on his way to the restaurant (what?!?)

GrubHub drivers make no attempt to deliver meaning: no phone calls, no texts, and no doorbell hits (I have a Ring so never seeing them even walk up to the front door of our brownstone is fun). I’ve been given the run around by support. I always get a refund but at a certain point — ordering food, waiting 1.5hours, and never getting that food, only to have to sit on a phone for half an hour to get some schmuck who wants to give you 50% refund bc of some bs “attempted delivery” when you have no food to show for it, is just asinine. I’ve spent thousands on this service over the years and it’s gone terribly downhill in the last two months in my area (Brooklyn Heights). Last time I ever use Seamless or Yelp for delivery. My money is going straight to local delivery guys who deserve it, and then to players like Caviar / Postmates who actually value their customers enough to keep this kind of thing from happening.

To Seamless / GrubHub if you are even listening: your core service offering is to provide food delivery to customers. Forget doing it with a smile or on time — but to not deliver at all, and to have no remedy for getting rid of bad drivers other than a refund is a serious failing on your model. Maybe if you paid your people better, and provided better incentives, your customers wouldn’t have their food stolen. At +$50 for a few of these orders, I should be calling my local precinct about the theft, maybe then I would’ve gotten some traction.",1,finally made forth stolen meal shy month half best part tonight wife birthday ordering favorite pastries grubhub drivers make attempt deliver meaning phone calls texts doorbell hits ring never seeing even walk front door brownstone fun given run around support always get refund certain point ordering food waiting hours never getting food sit phone half hour get schmuck wants give refund bc bs attempted delivery food show asinine spent thousands service years gone terribly downhill last two months area brooklyn heights last time ever use seamless yelp delivery money going straight local delivery guys deserve players like caviar postmates actually value customers enough keep kind thing happening seamless grubhub even listening core service offering provide food delivery customers forget smile time deliver remedy getting rid bad drivers refund serious failing model maybe paid people better provided better incentives customers food stolen orders calling local precinct theft maybe would gotten traction,Negative,-0.4497,finally made forth stolen meal shy month half best part tonight wife birthday ordering favorite pastry grubhub driver make attempt deliver meaning phone call text doorbell hit ring never seeing even walk front door brownstone fun given run around support always get refund certain point ordering food waiting hour never getting food sit phone half hour get schmuck want give refund bc b attempted delivery food show asinine spent thousand service year gone terribly downhill last two month area brooklyn height last time ever use seamless yelp delivery money going straight local delivery guy deserve player like caviar postmates actually value customer enough keep kind thing happening seamless grubhub even listening core service offering provide food delivery customer forget smile time deliver remedy getting rid bad driver refund serious failing model maybe paid people better provided better incentive customer food stolen order calling local precinct theft maybe would gotten traction,final made forth stolen meal shi month half best part tonight wife birthday order favorit pastri grubhub driver make attempt deliv mean phone call text doorbel hit ring never see even walk front door brownston fun given run around support alway get refund certain point order food wait hour never get food sit phone half hour get schmuck want give refund bc bs attempt deliveri food show asinin spent thousand servic year gone terribl downhil last two month area brooklyn height last time ever use seamless yelp deliveri money go straight local deliveri guy deserv player like caviar postmat actual valu custom enough keep kind thing happen seamless grubhub even listen core servic offer provid food deliveri custom forget smile time deliv remedi get rid bad driver refund seriou fail model mayb paid peopl better provid better incent custom food stolen order call local precinct theft mayb would gotten traction

I am not one to write a scathing review, but after experiencing such poor service time and time again I could not stand for it much longer. Recently, my orders have habitually been extremely late (e.g. 1 hr from the estimated arrival) or cancelled after I’ve waited for a substantial amount of time. To make matters worse, the Seamless customer service does not offer any type of resolution to ameliorate the situation. More often than not, representatives tell me that there is not much they can do other than call the restaurant/driver or cancel the order and refund me. This doesn’t solve my problem of needing food to be delivered to me. Based on such response by Seamless, it appears that they do not care that the users time is wasted waiting for food that will not come.

When we talked to customer service, they explained it was canceled and that the driver had no way to reach us as their gps was automatically rerouted to a new order!

Only a few minutes before this, we had a phone call from shake shack confirming an issue with the order where they ran out of chicken bites, so we swapped it for another burger instead. They said this would be fine and hung up. 

We were so confused when we got an email about the order cancellation cause the driver already picked up the order and was on their way. Now after over an hour and a half of waiting, we have nothing. They offered us a discount on our next order but everything is already closed.

2447,"1. No default address setting 
2. Closed restaurants display as if open
3. Restaurants shown to user are based off user shopping habits rather than proximity
4. Extremely limited filtering options

————-

1. Where are most of the people accessing this app? At home. But occasionally, users will order food to OTHER locations: friends homes, family’s homes, an Airbnb, hotel, etc. Users will always remember to update address to a non-home location when ordering. Why doesn’t my address reset back to my default location so that I don’t accidentally order food to a place that isn’t my home? 

2. You can turn on the app and see hundreds of restaurants if you live in a major city. What you don’t know is that most of them are closed but there’s no way to tell. Grubhub needs to hold restaurants accountable for accurate store hours and update their UI to show closed restaurants as soon as they close. Why can I not filter based on hours of operation for a restaurant? 

3. A lot of people order the same things over time but everyone gets bored of the same meal nonstop. Everyone will want to explore new options. Why are the hundreds of restaurants hidden by ones that I’ve recently ordered from? Show me restaurants based on proximity in that order with go-to place in a separate list and highlighted in the main display so they stand out.

4. The fact that I can’t filter by cuisine without typing it in is horrible. What if I’m looking for Italian OR Asian? I can’t do that in one search? What if I want those two types but ordered by proximity AND price? 

Fire your product managers working on this app. These are BASIC functionality and with the surge in online orders, Grubhub has the cash to invest in product improvement so do it.

2490,"Seamless used to be my favorite third party app for food delivery. I would say in the past 2 years they’ve started to imitate certain fees and features that UBEREATS and DoorDash are famous for and I’m not sure why they would do that when they were one of the best in the first place. Before all the changes, only restaurants that used their own drivers were on the app. It was great because the tip went directly to the drivers and if there was an issue you could call the restaurant directly. Then they started hiring drivers themselves in order to accommodate places that normally didnt offer deliveries, but this came with tons of fees and parameters. If you ordered from KFC for example, there’d be a delivery fee, plus a service fee, small order fee, PLUS tax and tip! However, ordering from these types of places was a choice and therefore Seamless was still #1. 

I don’t know why they decided to implement more changes but it’s absolutely shameful that y’all are charging service fees for ALL restaurants even if they DONT USE YOUR DRIVERS! How money hungry of you guys! I tried to place an order yesterday with and the service fee was $3.50! That’s ridiculous and so unnecessary.

Called the business and they said it was seamless responsibility to check the order before the left to deliver it. When I called seamless they refused to deliver missing items but offered a refund of the items only with no willingness to let me talk it over with a manager. So what I learned is that seamless will not do anything to make right their delivery persons mistake except a refund which does nothing to help me get my lunch at the moment. Will definitely use another delivery company.,1,ordered restaurant seamless delivery order missing delivered called business said seamless responsibility check order left deliver called seamless refused deliver missing items offered refund items willingness let talk manager learned seamless anything make right delivery persons mistake except refund nothing help get lunch moment definitely use another delivery company,Negative,-0.7549,ordered restaurant seamless delivery order missing delivered called business said seamless responsibility check order left deliver called seamless refused deliver missing item offered refund item willingness let talk manager learned seamless anything make right delivery person mistake except refund nothing help get lunch moment definitely use another delivery company,order restaur seamless deliveri order miss deliv call busi said seamless respons check order left deliv call seamless refus deliv miss item offer refund item willing let talk manag learn seamless anyth make right deliveri person mistak except refund noth help get lunch moment definit use anoth deliveri compani

2604,"Where do i even begin? This App has been infuriating for a very long time now. I can’t even possibly list all the problems with this app in one review, it would have to be a thesis essay so I’ll try to shorten it and focus on the worst problems here. TLDR tho: AVOID THIS APP AND USE SOMETHING ELSE!!

So, I see one of the most critical problems with Seamless that could actively hurt businesses and seamless could actually be sued for it, is that they have this horrific glitch where it will label restaurants as closed sometimes and not taking orders when in fact certain restaurants, if you call them, are very much open. That just disables people from being able to order from their favorite restaurants and incorrectly labels the restaurants as not operational at certain times when they totally are. What the actual hell? And to make matters worse there’s an absolute myriad of other stupid glitches that they also haven’t fixed after multiple useless updates. 

For example, I cannot save ANY restaurants to my saved list on the app, i have to do it on the computer. Sure, minor inconvenience maybe, but if I find a particularly good restaurant and want to save it so I remember that it’s there I could forget it and then won’t be able to find it again. Whenever I try to save something it says “please try again” which is obnoxious. Besides this particular glitch there are a lot of times where things won’t show up on the menu that should, things won’t load properly, or it’ll act buggy and unresponsive, so I have to quit out and restart Seamless. 

Gotta say, the interface for seamless is overall just really crappy and not well-made. It’s like they outsourced it to a company in a foreign country that doesn’t know how to code anything. 

Further, having to call customer service, where people speak rough English every time you have a problem with an order instead of having a built-in order help functionality to dispute a problem with an order is really a pain. Not to mention the fact that seamless‘ “operating cost” fees are ridiculous. I don’t know why Uber and seamless started to enact these fees now but they serve no purpose. Despite a global pandemic, these companies have a lot of money as it is and they’re being greedy. There’s way too many delivery fees and taxes and extra crap as is so this just seems unnecessary and obnoxious. 

Overall, the devs are either incompetent or simply don’t care to deliver a good experience for online ordering because there are so many serious problems, minor frustrations and obnoxiously overpriced order fees. You’re really just better off picking up food from a restaurant, actually going outside and getting food for takeout or outdoor seating, or just using a different service.

2656,"For the basic ordering of food, it’s fine. Too many steps to read reviews, and some big chains don’t display reviews, so why a particular franchise location has such a low rating is hard to discern. I err on the side of caution and do t order from them. 

The worst part of the app is the experience of signing-up for Seamless plus. I tried twice and it took four phone calls to get it right. 

I singed up as prompted during a check out with a restaurant. The itemised membership for $9.99 was right there. But a day later, the app still prompted me at every turn to sign-up. I could see no sign in account settings it was active. And no free deliveries for Seamless + participating businesses. 

First call I was told it would take 48 hours. Second call I was told I had signed up for Grub Hub plus and not Seamless+. Really? Inside the Seamless app. Insisted I had done so. So I tried again. Had to call back to get a refund for GrubHub+, and to see my status as a member. Still, some restaurants were charging for delivery while being listed CLEARLY as free delivery and being a Seamless+ participant.

By the way, the delivered order still showed it to be out for delivery and would for five days. 

Third call I was told, I kid you not, some restaurants participating in Seamless+ don’t offer free delivery. So I had a perk for free delivery for just such a place, which was $5 off AND free delivery. I apply the perk and the line-item order at checkout listed a delivery fee (no free indicator), a service fee (said to be waived because of Seamless+), and no indication of the $5 off where it is usually listed. Instead there was a line item marked separately and NOT adding up to the delivery fee, service fee, and $5 off. 

Fourth call and the rep claimed that was the Seamless+ freebies and the $5 off. Also claimed my refund for the never-wanted GrubHub membership had been applied when it had not. I had to demand it there on the phone. This refund had been promised to be next day and it had been a week. 

In summary: either there are hidden rules you can never be aware of, or this app shares data with the GrubHub app and confuses them. The order summary sometimes doesn’t show the discount(s) in a manner that accounts for perks, etc clearly. You might be signed up for another service entirely without being able to see this.

Regularly missing items, condiments and cutlery always missing, even large items in separate bags missing, like shakes or sodas. It honestly costs the same or even less to use far more advanced services like Post Mates. And you never have the constant deals that Uber Eats offers. 

Yes, you/Grub Hub is usually there to take calls and make good on missing items, COLD, super late or disgusting food (when restaurant’s fault—EXCEPT when closed & you make us wait) BUT like I said, at these prices, there should NOT be major or constant issues. Furthermore, missing items typically means one or more person has their meal ruined and just paying back that particular item does little to remedy that.
