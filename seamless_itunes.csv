24/9/2017,381840917,,us,en,4.31.1,I've got a crush on you!,4,Addictive!,Be careful what you wish for. This convenient app will have you spending all your money on takeout!  But it will allow you to quickly and easily try some new options for food delivery in your area. Not every neighborhood will have the same kind of options but this app works very well in terms of getting food delivered to you especially in New York City.  I would love to see the opportunity to add little notes about what dishes I previously liked so that I can remember what to order and what not to order the next time I order from the same restaurant. I do like however that they show you your previous order and you can quickly re-order the same exact order. This app is too convenient I am forgetting how to cook!,,,28/9/2017 23:08,"Hi I've got a crush on you!, Thank you for the feedback.

27/10/2017,381840917,,us,en,4.31.1,Margaret Moore,1,Truly the worst food delivery app out there - I don't understand how this company is surviving,"Seamless is truly the worst food delivery app out there. I do not understand how this company is still in business. I've given this app multiple chances and every single time that I use it, something goes wrong - whether it's taking two hours instead of 45 minutes to deliver (this has happened every time I've ordered) or in the most recent instance where they literally cancelled my order 10 minutes after it was supposed to be delivered. That last experience was the most absurd situation I've experienced when it comes to food delivery apps - there was no apology or explanation it was just a note that my order had been cancelled and when I called customer service they could not have been less helpful. There are so many other and better options out there - stay clear of this one. Officially deleting this app and never looking back - I hope you do the same!",,,8/8/2018 23:13,Hi Margaret Moore.

10/11/2017,381840917,,us,en,4.34,KickLish,5,Love this app. Reliable. Amazing customer service.,"Seamless is the best. I have been using this product for years to order lunch at work, order dinner at home, order dessert and order breakfast in bed... I love you Seamless!

The few times I’ve had issues were resolved quickly by Seamless over the phone with a refund and credit/discounts for future orders. They were usually because the vendor at the store/restaurant made an error. I choose Seamless even when I have the menu and info to order directly to vendors because I don’t want to have to talk to people on a phone to get food. I just want to order it by tapping a few options and getting it to me ASAP (which in midtown Manhattan for me is 20-45min).

Thanks Seamless!",,,8/8/2018 23:21,Hi Kicklish. We appreciate the positive feedback.

30/11/2017,381840917,,us,en,4.34.1,Harakirijasper,1,Used to work,"Seamless used to be our go-to-app.  Sadly their services and app update really made food ordering difficult.  First off many restaurants we were able to order from, are no longer available. When inquired, Seamless responded “we don’t see a large enough order from This area so we are no longer delivering food to this area.”  Now, according to these restaurants they still order to our address. 
Secondly, when food is ordered, addressed needs to be re-entered and I️t says food can of be ordered because it’s out of delivery area.  When inquired, seamless suggested that we use the web GUI.  Right, instead of fixing the problem or apologizing, try the website.  

There are plenty other food delivery services that can be used in NYC. Guess we don’t see a reason to continue supporting Seamless although we continued supporting using their services after they hiked up their “delivery” fee just as soon as they took over the delivery from the local restaurants.",,,8/8/2018 23:16,"Hi Harakirijasper.

15/12/2017,381840917,,us,en,4.35,DERP the hero,2,Good app with one HUGE flaw,"Seamless is an extremely streamlined and accessible app that shows you hundreds of restaurants in your neighborhood and even some you might not know about. In most cases it works very well and even when it doesn’t the customer support is top notch with short wait times and support representatives who know what they are doing and know the solution to most, if not all, problems. One system, however, is by far the most baffling one I’ve ever seen; When a restaurant doesn’t have its own staff for delivery, seamless will send it’s own drivers to pick it up and deliver it to you. The problem is that seamless gives the restaurant no way to identify a driver besides the driver saying so. This can lead to smart thieves walking into restaurants with the seamless logo on the window and walking out with your food because they claimed to be drivers. This is a huge oversight and I’ve gotten food stolen from me already. Fix this seamless, and you get 5 stars, this should not have been a problem in the first place.",,,8/8/2018 22:57,Hi DERP the hero. We are sorry to hear about this.

Twice in a row, seamless showed a restaurant to be open (not an odd time, like in the afternoon, for Lunch) and listed a delivery wait Time.  I ordered and received a confirmation and a delivery time from seamless.  Then, nothing happened.  No delivery, called the restaurant and there was no answer.  Here’s the weird part - no refund was ever issued unless I called Seamless to register a complaint. Just not acceptable.  Customer service gave me the lame explanation that the restaurant closed for the prior night and just didn’t turn off seamless.   Just ridiculous.   So beware.  Track your order carefully.  Even call the restaurant.  Better yet, use another service that doesn’t suffer from this amateur problem.  I use caviar now.

It’s not the end of the world for one order, but if you get takeout, have to pay a delivery tip and a fee for a salad or sandwich, it would anger you too. Or if you have to say yes to four restaurants before you find one that doesn’t try to gouge you, you’d be angry from that as well.

This is a story about mediocre customer service. And remember: I’m just ordering take-out Chinese food. Seamless is attempting to take something that is already trivially easy and make it easier. But then this happens.

Placed our order at 10:01pm, 30-40 minute delivery. At 10:55pm I called the restaurant for an update. I was told only the manager handled online orders, and would have to call me back. Someone called back at 10:58pm to say my order was on its way. Tried calling again at 11:27pm, but no answer. Called Seamless at 11:28pm. Was told that they wouldn’t issue a refund until they spoke with the restaurant — which was now closed. Was also told that the food was delivered at 10:55pm, three minutes before the manager called me to tell me it was out for delivery. Seamless was not able to reach the restaurant, as expected. Despite the fact that I specifically asked Seamless to call me back with the update, they managed to go straight to voicemail. I tweeted Seamless with my frustration and complaint. They reconfirmed all of this, and said they would issue a refund immediately “as a one time courtesy”, and made it very clear that they don’t trust “claims” until they speak to the restaurant.

As of 1:00am — hours after the restaurant closed — the Seamless app still reported that my order was out for delivery.

Seamless took a frustrating delivery experience and turned it into an angering, insulting mess, holding me and my money hostage. They made it clear that issuing refunds promptly and without a complicated discussion across multiple channels is something they consider a “one time courtesy”. Having spent a lot of money over the years with Seamless, without issue, this is insulting. I should have just ordered from the restaurant over the phone and avoided all of this, except the missed delivery. At least then the only thing I would be missing would be my food.

It’s impossible to get through one entire food order without experiencing one or more of these problems. If Seamless had a decent competitor, I’d have already abandoned this incredibly buggy software.

And to the asshats who manage this POS, you do realize that the “Your go-to” BS actually *discourages* me from ever clicking through to that restaurant again, right?

on its face.

PROs
I love the quick ordering, express reorder, the fact that I can handle gratuity in the app - all works well. Support has been excellent the few times I needed it. Choice of restaurants is pretty decent.  Ability to search for a specific food item, filter by a number of different metadata elements, all add to convenience.

CONS
Choice of restaurant is decent but incomplete in my neighborhood - some number of places aren’t in seamless yet. I also live on a neighborhood boundary which confuses the app; it will let me order from places that won’t deliver to me, and refuses to take orders from places that do, which means I have to call them.   Final con: the delivery estimates are absolute garbage. I’ve almost never had one come close, and the app does not provide updates. A basic: “order has left restaurant” would be handy.",,,6/5/2018 22:01,"Hello, Whydonickshavetobeunique?! We're happy to hear that you are enjoying our app!

Hot and cold foods are separated and arrive as expected. Hard to go wrong with Hanabi. Seamless is the only negative because they calculate tip on top of tax instead of just the food so when you tip 20% they knock it down. There is no service involved in adding tax so it shouldn’t be included in the tip calculation.

1/4/2018,381840917,,us,en,7.2,Joguinn,1,Seamless seems to misrepresent the order status,"We ordered food at 1:30 on Easter Sunday from a restaurant that was listed as open on Seamless. A little while later, we got a notification from seamless saying the order was in the works. The ETA came and went, so we waited a little longer (an hour and a half from the time we ordered) and called the restaurant three times. No answer. We chat with Seamless, who calls the restaurant, receives no answer, and offers to cancel the order.

Restaurants forget to update their status on holidays. I get that.

It’s an annoying change because I, personally, will not order from any restaurant that charges a delivery fee. I always tip well, but I’m not paying a fee. In the old version, fees were displayed within the headers on the main list of restaurants, so you could simply disregard those which charge a fee.

Hmm ok which I told them if it is not here by then please cancel the order. Of course it doesn’t come within that time because why would it? I proceed to order from UberEats which gets to me in 20 minutes. 

Now, when I contact Seamless about it they say they have to check with the restaurant to see if they’ll give me a refund...what??? They should be answering to you, it’s doubtful the restaurant is going to admit to anything being wrong. When I ask the agent if she thinks it’s right that it took 2 1/2 hours to have food delivered and still be charged full-price, she ignores me and proceeds to say they can offer me a credit...which then I also never get.

3/7/2018,381840917,,us,en,,SamfromOC22,1,"Premium Delivery Charge, Completely unsatisfactory experience","Expect to pay more for delivery compared to every food delivery app out there, for the same exact service. 

*Please refer to my first review experience review below for more information. The restaurants name is irrelevant as I expect many other restaurants ""provide their own drivers"" as well*

Two reasons why this was my first seamless order and last. 

First, I didn't eat dinner last night (thanks to this restaurant). I decided to try a new service that claimed to provide a easy stress-free ""no-human"" service. I guess I did get a ""no-human"" service because my food never came. After first calling the restaurant asking about my orders status, I was told I would have to wait only 10 minutes longer passed my estimated delivery time, no problem. Only this was a horrible lie as I waited another 30 before I called customer service for an updated ETA for just 20 minutes longer, ""fine I can wait"" I thought, until a total two hours after my initial order (which was placed when I was already feeling hungry as many of your customers probably do). Finally I decided to cancel my order and go to sleep hungry because any buisness that lies to its customers especially *hungry paying customers* does not deserve my, or anyone else's, buisness. (Edit: This was 2 hours after my order was placed, and still no update after the initial ""the restaurant is now preparing your order"" status)

Second, Seamless charges a $9 delivery fee for this restaurant, I assumed that meant I would get a service that reflects that price *especially since the SAME delivery order can be made on yelp with a $2 delivery charge*. Unfortunately this premium delivery price comes with the exact same quality service as the $2 ,or even free, delivery option. When I initially asked Seamless customer service why my order had *no* status update 40 minutes after my order confirmation (which was my estimated delivery wait time) I was told that this restaurant provides their own driver...

This is more insulting than a seamless delivery driver being late because this means *there is no difference your service provides from any other* I might as well call the buisness myself, pay less of a delivery charge, and get the same horrible service this restaurant provides. 

If your restaurants provide their own drivers, you must hold them to the standards you'd for your own drivers. Read the reviews, this isn't uncommon with this restaurant. Disappointing.",,,5/7/2018 05:54,"Hi SamfromOC22, we're very sorry to hear that you had a terrible experience with us and would love to make it up to you.

When you reorder an item that isn’t on the menu exactly how it was when previously ordered(ie the vendor has updated the item even if that item is still available) you get an incorrect error message at checkout saying that restaurant doesn’t deliver to your address(not true) or your payment details need to be updated(also not the case). 

Everything works after clearing your cart and making the selection through the restaurant page. 

The reorder process bugging out when the item has changed makes some sense but the incorrect error message is AWFUL. You end up wasting so much time trying to fix payment details or stop ordering from your favorite restaurants because you think they no longer deliver to your address. 

Let’s hope for a fix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/381840917/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=2844665597,https://appfollow.io/app/50238/review/108414867?s=global2,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/my-first-workspace/reviews/485149?review_id=108414867

22/7/2018,381840917,,us,en,7.10.1,cornwellsb,1,Moving to DoorDash or Uber,I live in NYC and I’ve been using seamless for 8 years.  Seamless is useful but the app experience has always been horrible.  If I want something like “Chicken fried steak” or even “fried chicken” the app returns results for EVERY restaurant with the words fried and or chicken.  This is 500 restaurants!  Finding a meal always takes an hour.  How after 8 years can your app still be this bad.  They should have fired their IT team (or whoever the CIO is) years ago because they obviously don’t know the concept of innovation.  I just downloaded the latest app and it now locks up my entire iPhone X for 20 seconds even after switching out of the app  ... deleted it and reinstalled.  Searching causes something crazy to happen to my phone.  You have lost the food deliver business seamless ...  you just have not realized it yet.,,,7/8/2018 04:20,"Hi cornwellsb.

7/8/2018,381840917,,us,en,,Techexpert25790,1,Update is terrible change it back,"The developer responded to me ""sorry for inconvenience we will pass on to higher ups"" wow this was detailed regarding the navigation of the site and ""higher ups?"" Thats pretty unprofessional use of language. As for someone who just said they are deleting their app and going to the competition, terrible customer service - this company needs to really get it together what a blow off response.

I liked that i could see the physical distance - how many miles each restaurant is away on the screen with all of the choices, i could see the delivery minimum fee on each restaurant with all of the choices, in NYC they might say delivery time of 20 min but if its a mile away its not real. You took all the tools away. And now i cant see distance or delivery minimums as i am scrolling. I dont need it sorted by distance from me - because i dont know with 300 delivery restaurants if i am after a few scrolls then looking at something over a mile away - there are no cars , its not smart to get cold food here!  This is a hassle clicking on each restaurant to see what the distance (not delivery time) is and the delivery minimum fee is to decide. 

I hate these changes.  Also you need to let the filter apply more than one fliter at a time. And change the word delivery fee to NO delivery fee in the filter. Im switching to delivery.com this is a hassle now i have to click on each one, i choose distance and fee then food. So i got warm food, no fee close by.",,,6/9/2019 15:41,"

You rob the restaurants forced to use your service of 30% - or more - directly out of their margins. Since restaurants don’t MAKE a 30% margin, I guess you figure they’ll make it up in tips.

26/9/2018,381840917,,us,en,,Lunaluvr44,1,Terrible customer service,"Tonight was my first experience using Seamless— and let me tell you, it was anything but. We placed an order at 6:30pm, was told it would be delivered between 7:15-7:30pm. At 7:30, I had not received any update on the order status, so I called the restaurant, who said they just then received my order. They assured me the food would be out of their hands within 20 minutes. Another 45 minutes later I called back and was told that a driver had come and left but did not take my order, which was ready. Finally after a very long hold I got through to Seamless customer service. The agent was polite and told us that our order would arrive in 7 minutes. It did not. We have no way of contacting the driver, and when we asked for a way to contact them, they told us we had to call Seamless’ customer service line again (which means another 5-10 minutes waiting on hold for an agent to pick up). While I was on hold my Seamless app finally updated my eta to 9:03-9:13pm and said the delivery biker was on the way. So the food was ready around 7:45pm and still wouldn’t get to me until and hour and a half after it was made- meaning it would be cold by the time I received it.

All in all, it took over 2 hours for this order to be delivered, without any updates from Seamless about any issues (my ETA even read 7:42-7:52 after 8pm had come and gone). I find this very unprofessional on Seamless’s part- if there are ongoing issues with communication to the restaurant or with delivery I should not have to seek out answers and updates on my order. And Seamless offered nothing but a half-hearted apology for our trouble. When I finally asked if a reimbursement was possible they offered a promo code to use on my next order. I rejected this, since I will not be using this app again in the future. Opt for Uber Eats, Postmates, or any other actually reliable food delivery service.",,,23/10/2018 17:45,"Hi Lunaluvr44

One seamless driver told me if they get less than $5 worth on tips they just ignored the order and never gets pick up at the restaurant 3. They always cancelled orders on rainy days just because they don’t have enough drivers.
So why giving service on rainy days if they are going to cancel orders and we their customers are going to starved. They are going to lose customers in a blink of an eye when they do this.

I’m the past I’ve used other delivery apps and my food has been 1 to 2 hours later because there wasn’t a driver assigned to pick up my food, so because of that I called the customer support to make sure that wasn’t the case so I didn’t have to wait 2 hours for my food for the second time. I call and the customer service and when I did, I was told that I was going to be put on hold so she could call the driver to see how long my food would take to get to me.

If you want to wait 2-3 hours to have your order cancelled at the last minute because there are no drivers on the road this is ur spot. You will starve to death messing with this app. Crazy part is Seamless won’t even tell u or message u to know or provide a map so ur aware of what’s really going with ur order. 90% of the time the restaurant has the food ready but they don’t have enough delivery workers. The other 10% of the time restaurants delivering ur food to the wrong place or not delivering it at all but having it written in as delivered. Seamless does things in the wrong order, they should do driver first, order second instead they do it the other way around and then ur food left at the restaurant and both u and them mad at seamless. DoorDash is my go to cause they have a map similar to the Uber map so you can see about how far your driver is, and they give you a small profile of ur dasher similar to the blurb on ur Uber driver. They match a driver first then let u order and if they don’t have drivers they tell u. Full transparency unlike seamless who will hide it from you.

Do not order from this app. The higher ups clearly do not intend to fix the delivery issues considering the other reviews. I’m sure there are other apps similar to Seamless like UberEats. Save your time and your hungry tummy.",,,10/12/2018 22:42,"Hey Hangry and Disappointed

I used to be a regular because I just hadn’t gotten around to exploring other delivery apps but I’ve just had it with Seamless. There is NO way for the user to know if there is an issue with the order until HOURS later. Their push notifications are automated and inaccurate. You will get a notification that the restaurant has confirmed your order and even that the order is on its way only to find out two hours later that the restaurant has been CLOSED this whole time. You only find this out because you get tired of waiting and start chasing everyone down, calling the restaurant and chatting with seamless. The only thing that Seamless CS can do for you that you can’t do is to contact the driver and even though you just spent hours waiting and feeling stressed all you get is a cancelled order and no consolation - not even an apology. Really, you deserve better. Stay away.",,,26/12/2018 23:25,Hi EK9191. We are sorry to hear about the issue with the delivery order.

11/2/2019,381840917,,us,en,7.24.1,AmmNotJamm,2,Not that intuitive sometimes.,"The usability on this app can be frustrating at times. Firstly I like the past orders section. However if I press on the name of restaurant it should bring me to the menu not to the last order I made. If I tap on the white card with the order details, then sure show me the last order I made. The expectation is that if I click on the name, I want to order something different from that restaurant. 
The other use case is viewing the status of my order. I have no idea how to do this. It was not appearing under My Seamless. If I tap on the gear icon I also don’t see anything related. Eventually I had to rely on my email to figure out the status. Loading into the app now I see that “Your Order has been picked up” but I never saw any intermediate status (order received, order in the works, etc). 
Additionally when I switched from delivery to pickup option, the tip section was impossible to toggle off without starting the whole process over. 
Lastly, the Restaurant tab times out so often it’s frustrating to click on. However as this could be due to a number of factors that are beyond developer control like poor connectivity, I mention it last. But it’s still important as many people I know order food on their commute home, so they aren’t on the best wifi.",,,13/2/2019 19:28,We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

2. Seamless only gives you the option to tip upfront.

3. If something happens to your order (like it doesn't show up and the driver marks it as completed), Seamless gives you no method of feedback for the driver, only the restaurant. No option to change the tip amount or report the driver or even a button to call customer service. There is no customer service available through the app at all. They only allow you to contact the restaurant, who will always tell you ""Seamless handles the drivers"".

The other 10% though... completely unacceptable. It’s like the drivers don’t know or don’t care that you can see where they’re at and the status of your delivery. I watched a driver pick up my order, and then sit in the same place for 30 minutes. When I questioned him about it after he arrived, he said he was taking a break. WELL THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU ACCEPT THE DELIVERY??? My food was cold and soggy from the condensation in the package. Other times, my food is picked up and taken 20 minutes in the wrong direction.

So a delivery person who drove 2 blocks in their car deserve the same as a waiter or bartender who served you for hrs. Not to mention that because of the fees seem less takes the restaurants already charge between 4-18 dollar delivery fees that are all collected by the owner not any of the workers. 2) Seamless sends you 0 discounts if you use the app regularly even though the restaurants incur all the losses they’re the ones who must still themselves offer discounts if any because seamless reserves them for customers who do NOT use the app. I apparently have an old account which I was unaware of, they kept sending me discounts through it and when I would order the they would be invalid.

30/3/2019 20:25,381840917,,us,en,7.27.1,Alyssa2727272727,5,Still the best option for food delivery,"After having seen my friends and my husband have some terrible experiences with DoorDash and UberEats over the past few months, I just wanted to leave a review here because every time I was thinking “this would never happen with Seamless”. 

Despite whatever minor complaints people leave on here (most of the ones I just read sound like a user issue, not a system issue imo), I believe Seamless is still the best app out there for food delivery, and one with the best customer service. 

I’ve been using it for over 6 years now, in 2 different cities, for delivery to 9 different addresses. The only 2 times I remember having an issue where the restaurant did not deliver or canceled my order, Seamless customer service reached out to me proactively over the phone and email before I even had a chance to reach out to them, and handled the issue in the most appropriate and considerate way imaginable. Which I’ll admit I was probably taking for granted until the above-mentioned bad experiences with other providers.

Bottom line is that I always feel like I can call and talk to a live person at Seamless if I ever have an issue (although I never really do or need to) who will want to help me, AND I can actually call the restaurant directly, and they will treat me as their customer. With the other apps, it’s become apparent that their customer service is nearly impossible to reach and then just read from a script like a robot not listening to what you’re actually saying, and if you try to call the restaurant, they refuse to deal with you because they consider the delivery person to be their customer because that’s who pays them directly. 

The app itself is great and so easy to use, and its features and functionality have been improving over the years. But one thing I would suggest for future updates would be the ability to rate and/or review individual menu items and/or post pictures with reviews because sometimes I feel like I need to go to Yelp to figure out what to order. Or just buy Yelp lol.",,,7/4/2019 19:21,"Hello Alyssa2727272727,Thank you for sharing your feedback.

That time came and went and they kept adding time. After an hour I went down and picked up my cold, soggy food myself. When I contacted customer service I was put on trial — and was told that I had to “prove it to them.” I spoke with 4 reps over the phone and chat and nobody helped me. They kept to their scripts. So not only did they lie about and charge me for delivery, I had to pay for cold inedible food. As a tech marketing director myself,  it’s pathetic to me how much money this company spends on NYC advertising to gain new customers but spends zero dollars on retaining their existing customers. That whole “have been around for 20 years” narrative becomes a laughing stock. Every other food service has decent customer service, and when customers report an issue, a refund is issued— not a credit— and they do the right thing. And guess what, they still have my business.

30/6/2019 16:35,381840917,,us,en,7.38,Beakerb82,2,Terrible update: no menu categories & hidden delivery fees,"Recent updates have really tanked the user experience. One, they got rid of menu categories. Try ordering from an NYC diner without it — ridiculous. Two, they removed delivery fee info from the main menu page so that you don’t see it until you’re about to check out and get hit with a $7.99 delivery charge — shady. At bare minimum they could put it in the restaurant’s About Info so that you don’t have to add a fake item and then go to your cart just to see how much the fee is.  

These changes clearly weren’t made with the user in mind, so I’m guessing they thought they’d please restaurant owners by forcing users to spend more time looking at their menus and not ruling a place out based on how high the fee is. Instead it makes me more inclined to reorder from places I already know (or not order at all) and creates frustration that spills over from Seamless onto the restaurant, which is ultimately bad for their business, not just for Seamless.

I’ve been moving over to Postmates/ Caviar for the last year and the experience I just had with their customer service representative just made me move 100% in that direction. 

1) there was a service fee on the delivery, which arrived over an hour later than I was told; this did not get refunded. They offered me “store credit” of $5 (this was a fifty dollar order...) instead, which, uh, I’m not going to use. 
2) my food arrived literally ice cold - no offer of compensation on this. I tipped 20%. Again- outside of the $5 offer above, no offer of compensation. 20% of $50 is ten dollars. Which is what I paid for my food to arrive cold. 
3) my food arrived MISSING ITEMS. The restaurant I ordered from always has a side with their sandwiches, no side. And then there’s the side I paid for - the only offer I got for a refund here was on the price of the item, not including tax/ tip/ service fee. And no partial refund for the missing included side?
4) the customer service rep was super rude - they didn’t offer anything aside from the $5 credit and the refunded item, and then kept putting me on hold just for the restaurant themselves to call me with info on my refund. If Seamless doesn’t do any of this on my end, why use them as a vendor?! There are better options out there. 

All in all, given the poor service I received today, I really wouldn’t re-download the app. And it would take WAY more for me to consider going back to Seamless - y’all aren’t the only game anymore.

The tracking system kept giving me false updates and after waiting for an hour and 20 minutes I had to contact them because I could see that the restaurant that I ordered from is closed although their deceiving buggy tracking system kept telling me that they are still working on my order and is just delayed. I would’ve not waited for all of that if they weren’t giving me those false updates. Of course the restaurant was closed long time ago, they couldn’t get them on the phone, meanwhile the tracking didn’t change, still working on it! They didn’t even bother to fix it. They refunded me and canceled the order “finally” at 12:18 am. I’ve tried to order something else ( from another app that give real updates and respect their customers’ time and hunger, unfortunately, there were no vegan options left.

Eventually, once the food said it was delivered we had to call the restaurant to ask if it was sent off to our address as we had not received it and of course it was not sent and they said they were waiting for it to be picked up. We were told to call grub hubs customer service and after being redirected 2 times, they said they could not offer us a refund on the 90$ worth of food that was never even sent to us because it had been delivered. Although we told them it had not been delivered to us they refused to listen or give us a refund and told us they could not send someone else to pick it up.

10/9/2019 09:54,381840917,,us,en,,Englishpancakes,1,Customer service nightmare,"I would order from seamless at least 3-4x a week. It was my first time trying out “Perks” and likely my last time ever using Seamless. 

Imagine receiving a notification from seamless that there is a concern about your order “Driver couldn’t reach you.” This is laughable because the driver never tried calling you to tell you he arrived or left. 

You remember Seamless providing the ability in the past to request refunds/indicate an issue with your order or chat via text with a rep. Not anymore. 

You call seamless/grubhub, stay on the line for 30 minutes watching your lunch hour tick away, only to first be told your driver is there (false). Then, after holding for much longer, you’re told the driver is on his next delivery already. But you’ve run out of time to eat (much less wait longer for the driver to come back), and so now you just want to cancel your order. The rep insists he cannot refund your order but will give you 50% off your next one. Good job taking my money and running. 

Now when you check your order status it is somehow “Delivered.” Ouch.

If it is “Perk” to never get your food and still have to pay for it, that’s pretty twisted. Anywhere else, that’s called a scam.",,,15/9/2019 14:27,Thank you for using Seamless.

The manager standing next to me was not named Robert, and my order was in my hand. Seamless then confirmed that the address was correct and couldn’t offer an explanation. I asked them to cancel the order so I can pay directly, but the Seamless rep hung up. I later received a voicemail that she got disconnected and would call me back. She never called back and she never cancelled the order, and the driver got a $21 tip while never picking up my food. This business is not friendly and does not treat the customer right.

The hidden delivery fees are exhausting to go through when choosing your restaurant. Used to be on the top of each page so the consumer has the ability to choose.

17/10/2019 21:15,381840917,,us,en,,T. Coffield,1,DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME.,"My partner is currently on dialysis so these delivery apps are great at times but TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE plays a really big part when using these delivery services but they all come with limitations. After placing many orders and having our food consistently and constantly incorrect. I decided to browse the App Store to see if there were any other delivery apps that serviced my areas with different options. I came across “Seamless” downloaded the app to give it a try. Once download was complete, I opened the app and right off hand I noticed the interface seemed very familiar. I proceeded to setup an account and unbeknownst to me my information was pre-populated. I felt it was my phone that may have pre-filled in all my information. I didn’t think anything about it. I was offered a discount with my first order. After placing everything in my cart I went to check-out and given a discount code to use once my order was complete. I tried to use the code but the code was invalid. Reasoning: “This code is valid for first time users only” as I was so confused by that message. I decided to chat with customer service within the app. Upon chatting with the customer service rep I was immediately reprimanded for trying to cheat the system. I was told I already have account. I informed the rep I have never used this app before, their response was, you have a “GRUB-HUB” account. I was shocked but not surprised. That’s something common in the U.S., companies are allowed to have multiple subsidiaries. It’s sad but hey, there is nothing you can do about it. Just be warned, “Seamless” is grubhub. In my case they have the same options with the same prices, fees, and incompetent delivery drivers. The old school customer service is gone. There isn’t one company that have workers that’s welling to go “above and beyond” any longer. One or ten bad experiences will no longer break a company, it’s enough people in this country that will keep a company afloat. SAD BUT TRUE. I no longer use any of these apps. I use Uber to pick up my food, at least I’m sure I will be correct plus I earn Uber points.",,,18/10/2019 23:48,"We sincerely apologize for the bad experience you had with us.

No only did the delivery guy claim to have delivered my food, he refused to answer the phone for me And the restaurant he works for. After all the calling back and forth, it’s now 11 p.m. and I knew I wouldn’t be able to get such healthy food at such an hour. So I decided to re-order the food and went to the restaurant to pick it up and paid cash.
I told the restaurant to take the $$ for my order out of his pay to make sure He didn’t get away with it. At least I was reimbursed for the order I Never received.... who would think about doing such a thing?
Besides, it’s Not like he got into an accident, maybe skidding in the water because of the rain... (yes, that happened before), but at least I got my food from a restaurant I always order from, so I knew my delivery guy on that run... This was the 1st time I ordered from this deli, but I see I’ll have to pick up my food from now on from this one.

You used to even be able to sort your delivery options by fee, but they’ve removed that that functionality. The fees are non-trivial- in Upper Manhattan, plenty of places have $8-10 fees, which add up. 

This is on top of service fees, and the tip- which they have somehow managed to screw up as well. The mobile app shows a different array of preset percentage options than the desktop site at this point, and while I support tipping well, having 25% be the default tip on the mobile app (on top of all these other hidden fees) is really offensive. 

There are other decent food delivery apps emerging as alternatives, and whenever possible, I’m using those now. Seamless is patently anti-consumer. For many years, I ordered from them at least 5x a week, and the only coupons or rewards I’ve seen showed up when Amazon Restaurants (which is now defunct) made a big push into NY. This company is almost contemptuous of its users- they know that they had a first-mover advantage in certain markets, and have really been milking it while doing the bare minimum.",,,12/11/2019 22:11,"Hi  Chris Lonardo, We are sorry to hear this.

Heaven forbid you decide to wait to see if the credit card statement will clear because then you will be outside of the seamless “24 hour query” window that allows you to dispute the order.

However, I ordered a happy meal from a McDonald’s that was 0.5 miles away from my apartment and the food arrived two hours later cold. Originally the app said my order would be delivered in 30 min. But I kept waiting and refreshing my app and the delivery time was never updated. After waiting an hour and a half I called and they contacted the driver and informed me he was 10 min away from the McDonald’s. 20 min later I got my food and it was ice cold, and the McFlurry I ordered was melted. Which makes no sense if it was only in a car for 10 min. What really bothers me is they have you tip the driver at online checkout instead of after the food is delivered. The driver obviously picked up my order much earlier and was taking his sweet time to deliver it. If I’d known all of that I wouldn’t have given him a tip at all. I understand certain situations happen, but to receive cold food after 2 hours with little updates when the McDonald’s was only half a mile away is ridiculous.

There should be a service fee flat rate of like $1. I also don’t see why I’m paying a delivery fee that isn’t going to the driver. It’s not like Seamless is paying for my driver’s transportation. My drivers usually come on bikes or little mopeds. I know good and well y’all are not giving them that money. And if y’all aren’t doing the delivery yourself there’s no reason you should be paid for their work. Unless you are using that money specifically for them. That goes for seamless, Taco Bell, or whoever needs to hear it. Sometimes I don’t have it on me to tip. Sometimes I don’t have the money. And the drivers are furious w that.

I know it was a Seamless issue because the driver was contacted and HAD the food, but did not deliver to me. I’m only rating here because I don’t want to give the poor restaurant a crappy review for Seamless’ fault for sending a bad delivery driver. The customer service was useless and offered me only discounts the “next time” I ordered, as if I would order again after that kind of delivery disaster. I gave Seamless a lot of chances, but after delivering my food consistently late (or not at all) for the past few months, I’ve stopped using the app entirely.

I decided to try out ordering at a restaurant that uses a driver. I closed my eyes for a few minutes because I had a pounding headache but left my ringer on, knowing I&#39;d get a call once he was here. Eventually I happened to check my phone, and saw there was one notification for Seamless that said my driver had been there for a couple of minutes but would only be there for a few more because he had been contacting me and waiting. I never received ANY calls or texts, I checked my call history, and when I tried calling him via the app it said there was a &#34;connection problem&#34;. It let me text him as I was running downstairs, but he never answered. It finally let me call him and he said he had already left and was &#34;too far away&#34; to come back, even though it had only been a few minutes. I tried calling Seamless customer service to get a refund, but after explaining the situation, they could only offer me a &#34;sorry&#34; and a discount on my next order because apparently in their history it said he called me. There is nothing in my call history, he never contacted me. How is this my fault? I&#39;m very upset with Seamless and would appreciate if someone would refund my order, otherwise I will be very wary of using this company for my deliveries in the future, as I cannot trust it.

Eventually I was told the order was ready but was still not picked up after 45 minutes, at which point I cancelled it knowing that the food would not be fresh. 

Jorge B, the person assigned to help, was not sympathetic of my situation at all. In fact, he refused to offer a reasonable compensation for this inconvenience, despite my repeated efforts to plead my case, and refused to escalate the matter to his superior, against my request.

This was a disappointing experience both on quality control and services. I strongly urge Seamless, as I’ve urged Jorge B, to reflect on this as a team and identify ways to avoid such experience for future customers. It’s doing yourselves a favor.

2/1/2020 23:29,381840917,,us,en,7.63.1,Phe-Phe,2,Really poor customer service,"I’ve used Seamless for over a year now very consistently (with work keeping me out late and sometimes too tired to cook). It’s been pretty helpful and good for me to be able to eat no matter what because I’ve struggled with that I’m the past.

That said, I had a terrible experience where food didn’t arrive at my apartment almost 3 hours after the I placed the order, from a restaurant only a mile away. I called after the order was an hour and a half late and the owner told me no drivers were available (which means the order should never have been accepted in my opinion). But he told me he would get it to me so I waited. It came while I was already in bed about to go to sleep having given up on the order. 

So I called customer support the next day and after being out on hold for 16 minutes I was hung up on with no follow up. The next call I made I was told I would receive a 20% discount for my next order, which to me might have been okay if it weren’t for the fact that I was given the run-around by the first agent. I asked for a refund and they said there was no way in the system to give me a refund for a late order. This second conversation lasted 14 minutes. Just to be told nothing could be done basically. 

Really left a bad taste in my mouth, so I won’t be using Seamless again. Give it a go if you want but this stuff can happen.",,,8/1/2020 21:06,Thanks for contacting us!

I’ve been using it for years and my last few orders have had delivery problems. I know it’s not with the restaurants because I call the restaurants and they say drivers either don’t come or they take the food. I ordered food earlier today and it never came. I called the restaurant and they told me the driver that came to get my food and another person is all of a sudden MIA. They told me to call seamless and told me they told the other guy to do the same. I call Seamless to get it resolved and they said the guy called me a couple of times (never got those calls btw) so they would only offer me 50% off my next order and not a refund. When I called the restaurant they said Seamless told the other guy the same thing. I essentially just paid $25 for Seamless to waste my time. This happened before and I ended up having to walk to the restaurant to get my food which kinda defeats the purpose of a delivery app. Screw this app. I’d rather pay the delivery fees from better apps and actually get my food than use Seamless again.

GrubHub drivers make no attempt to deliver meaning: no phone calls, no texts, and no doorbell hits (I have a Ring so never seeing them even walk up to the front door of our brownstone is fun). I’ve been given the run around by support. I always get a refund but at a certain point — ordering food, waiting 1.5hours, and never getting that food, only to have to sit on a phone for half an hour to get some schmuck who wants to give you 50% refund bc of some bs “attempted delivery” when you have no food to show for it, is just asinine. I’ve spent thousands on this service over the years and it’s gone terribly downhill in the last two months in my area (Brooklyn Heights). Last time I ever use Seamless or Yelp for delivery. My money is going straight to local delivery guys who deserve it, and then to players like Caviar / Postmates who actually value their customers enough to keep this kind of thing from happening.

To Seamless / GrubHub if you are even listening: your core service offering is to provide food delivery to customers. Forget doing it with a smile or on time — but to not deliver at all, and to have no remedy for getting rid of bad drivers other than a refund is a serious failing on your model. Maybe if you paid your people better, and provided better incentives, your customers wouldn’t have their food stolen. At +$50 for a few of these orders, I should be calling my local precinct about the theft, maybe then I would’ve gotten some traction.",,,24/1/2020 00:08,"Hello!

I’m not using grubhub right? WRONG. Even though I placed the order on seamless the delivery driver ONLY received my Incorrect grubhub details. Therefore after not bothering to buzz my apartment, the driver did not receive an answer when he called my incorrect grubhub number and did not deliver my food.

I am not one to write a scathing review, but after experiencing such poor service time and time again I could not stand for it much longer. Recently, my orders have habitually been extremely late (e.g. 1 hr from the estimated arrival) or cancelled after I’ve waited for a substantial amount of time. To make matters worse, the Seamless customer service does not offer any type of resolution to ameliorate the situation. More often than not, representatives tell me that there is not much they can do other than call the restaurant/driver or cancel the order and refund me. This doesn’t solve my problem of needing food to be delivered to me. Based on such response by Seamless, it appears that they do not care that the users time is wasted waiting for food that will not come.

We called Seamless and they said the driver “attempted to deliver our food” and would cancel our order and only refund us HALF of what we paid for food we never received.

Answer:  This one ... and only this one.

I really don’t want to chat with a service representative just to report a missing item.  I am sure they do this hoping you won’t go through the hassle.  Nice way to treat your customers.

I stopped using Seamless for a couple of years because of the disrespectful way they treat their customers.  Nothing has changed.

Recently (for months really) drivers, who are employed by Grubhub go late to pick up the food, so that it is cold by the time it gets to you.  The timing that you are expecting (as calculated by the algorithm) is often missed and delayed by more than a half hour or an hour.

I changed the delivery instructions to call me and I manually put in the correct number just in case but the delivery people don’t bother to look at the instructions. Here’s the thing though. Why did the delivery guy have the wrong number but the restaurant was able to call me to tell me he was outside? How does that work? I ended up not getting my order the other night because of this and seamless denied my refund even though it was their mistake. After an exhausting search to be able to contact seamless (why did you guys suddenly decide to hide any way to contact you?) I got in touch with somebody who kept telling me to update my information in the app. Yeah buddy I did that 2 years ago thanks. That chat was going nowhere so I had to google the now secret phone number to call seamless and the person I spoke to, Carlos, basically told me the same thing and that they couldn’t refund the order but could send me promo codes to use in the future...and then never sent them. Carlos told me to email them. I asked for the email contact and he said he would text it to me. Guess who never got that text. I. Am. Done. With. You.

Seamless completely let me down, they canceled my order even thou I had received an email from the representative I had contacted. They told me my food would be on its way ASAP, I had already waited for 2 hours.

They didn’t bother calling the restaurant and they promised me a 50% off coupon, but I only received a 20% off coupon with the purchase above 50 dollars. 

They kept changing my ETA time and I never received a notification of this delays, then after talking to a representative and being assured my food was on its way they cancel over an email not even 5 minutes after I hang up the phone?????? 

Extremely unprofessional. Extremely frustrating. 

I could not leave my house because of my infant child, in Brooklyn, alone in my apartment because we are somewhat lucky my husband still has a job due to the corona virus.

Also, Seamless does not give me refund, and they are only willing to send me a 50% off coupon.

Then I get a call from the restaurant asking if I wanted to pick up the food. Turns out that this restaurant was not in delivery range of my home but Seamless presented it that way regardless. Of course, the whole reason we ordered delivery was because we didn’t have any way to pick up.

So now I’ve got to rush something together to feed everyone and it’s going to be more canned slop because Seamless screwed up. Ruined what was our first otherwise good day in a while.

Spoiler alert! Not exactly. I’ve used this app a couple of times and each time it is always a mess just o get my delivery! Even if the restaurant is less than a mile away! It is either a issue with who’s picking up the order or a mistake in pick up with this company. Worst case scenario, the delivery guy takes an extra hour to deliver to my home! Leaving me waiting almost two hours for an order! 

Don’t even get me started on the outrageous tip vs delivery fee!! At this point I just started calling the shops directly to avoid the extra $5 in delivery fees that should go to who ever is delivering AS A TIP! This app is garbage and my god, their own staff seems to all be in the same boat. 

Stop wasting your time with this app when ordering. Just get the information from the restaurant and order outside of this crap adventure/cash grab.

Also, today I placed an order for delivery. Had an issue that required me to wait a extra 1 hour for my food to be remade and delivered. Guess what! MY DELIVERY PERSON MIA HAD A FRIEND IN THE CAR WHO TRIED TO SELL ME A NUTCRACKER AKA HOME MADE MIXED ALCHOL! This has been a horrid experience from start to finish.

24/5/2020 18:11,381840917,,us,en,7.83,Fb Employee,2,Horrible UX,"1. No default address setting 
2. Closed restaurants display as if open
3. Restaurants shown to user are based off user shopping habits rather than proximity
4. Extremely limited filtering options

————-

1. Where are most of the people accessing this app? At home. But occasionally, users will order food to OTHER locations: friends homes, family’s homes, an Airbnb, hotel, etc. Users will always remember to update address to a non-home location when ordering. Why doesn’t my address reset back to my default location so that I don’t accidentally order food to a place that isn’t my home? 

2. You can turn on the app and see hundreds of restaurants if you live in a major city. What you don’t know is that most of them are closed but there’s no way to tell. Grubhub needs to hold restaurants accountable for accurate store hours and update their UI to show closed restaurants as soon as they close. Why can I not filter based on hours of operation for a restaurant? 

3. A lot of people order the same things over time but everyone gets bored of the same meal nonstop. Everyone will want to explore new options. Why are the hundreds of restaurants hidden by ones that I’ve recently ordered from? Show me restaurants based on proximity in that order with go-to place in a separate list and highlighted in the main display so they stand out.

4. The fact that I can’t filter by cuisine without typing it in is horrible. What if I’m looking for Italian OR Asian? I can’t do that in one search? What if I want those two types but ordered by proximity AND price? 

Fire your product managers working on this app. These are BASIC functionality and with the surge in online orders, Grubhub has the cash to invest in product improvement so do it.

It gets 1 Star for just being an app and 1 more star for good customer service.

I would say in the past 2 years they’ve started to imitate certain fees and features that UBEREATS and DoorDash are famous for and I’m not sure why they would do that when they were one of the best in the first place. Before all the changes, only restaurants that used their own drivers were on the app. It was great because the tip went directly to the drivers and if there was an issue you could call the restaurant directly. Then they started hiring drivers themselves in order to accommodate places that normally didnt offer deliveries, but this came with tons of fees and parameters. If you ordered from KFC for example, there’d be a delivery fee, plus a service fee, small order fee, PLUS tax and tip! However, ordering from these types of places was a choice and therefore Seamless was still #1. 

I don’t know why they decided to implement more changes but it’s absolutely shameful that y’all are charging service fees for ALL restaurants even if they DONT USE YOUR DRIVERS! How money hungry of you guys! I tried to place an order yesterday with and the service fee was $3.50! That’s ridiculous and so unnecessary.

Called the business and they said it was seamless responsibility to check the order before the left to deliver it. When I called seamless they refused to deliver missing items but offered a refund of the items only with no willingness to let me talk it over with a manager. So what I learned is that seamless will not do anything to make right their delivery persons mistake except a refund which does nothing to help me get my lunch at the moment.

Then I noticed recently they started introducing fees like Ubereats and DoorDash. They weren’t awful at first like a dollar or two . Now I’ll order 10-15$ of food and end up paying 20-30$. That’s not including if there is a delivery fee on top of it. The fees get placed in the subtotal so that ups the taxes and the tip and I’m not gunna short change the restaurant on a tip because of these extra fees. But I also won’t order at all if I’m paying40-70% more on my orders.

Since the pandemic, I added ""contact-free delivery,"" with instructions to text me. I do this out of safety and also because it speeds up the process so the delivery person doesn't have to wait for me to run downstairs and I don't have to worry about holding them up if I somehow don't receive their call.
Today, I received a text from the app saying they would be arriving soon (they were already delayed) but no call. Then ten minutes later, I receive another text from the app saying that they have been trying to contact me when I haven't received a call or a notification.
The delivery man was understandably very upset and walked off before I could explain.

28/8/2020 16:29,381840917,,us,en,2020.34,A Random Person with no name,1,Probably one of the worst apps I’ve ever had the misfortune to use.,"Where do i even begin? This App has been infuriating for a very long time now. I can’t even possibly list all the problems with this app in one review, it would have to be a thesis essay so I’ll try to shorten it and focus on the worst problems here. TLDR tho: AVOID THIS APP AND USE SOMETHING ELSE!!

So, I see one of the most critical problems with Seamless that could actively hurt businesses and seamless could actually be sued for it, is that they have this horrific glitch where it will label restaurants as closed sometimes and not taking orders when in fact certain restaurants, if you call them, are very much open. That just disables people from being able to order from their favorite restaurants and incorrectly labels the restaurants as not operational at certain times when they totally are. What the actual hell? And to make matters worse there’s an absolute myriad of other stupid glitches that they also haven’t fixed after multiple useless updates. 

For example, I cannot save ANY restaurants to my saved list on the app, i have to do it on the computer. Sure, minor inconvenience maybe, but if I find a particularly good restaurant and want to save it so I remember that it’s there I could forget it and then won’t be able to find it again. Whenever I try to save something it says “please try again” which is obnoxious. Besides this particular glitch there are a lot of times where things won’t show up on the menu that should, things won’t load properly, or it’ll act buggy and unresponsive, so I have to quit out and restart Seamless. 

Gotta say, the interface for seamless is overall just really crappy and not well-made. It’s like they outsourced it to a company in a foreign country that doesn’t know how to code anything. 

Further, having to call customer service, where people speak rough English every time you have a problem with an order instead of having a built-in order help functionality to dispute a problem with an order is really a pain. Not to mention the fact that seamless‘ “operating cost” fees are ridiculous. I don’t know why Uber and seamless started to enact these fees now but they serve no purpose. Despite a global pandemic, these companies have a lot of money as it is and they’re being greedy. There’s way too many delivery fees and taxes and extra crap as is so this just seems unnecessary and obnoxious. 

Overall, the devs are either incompetent or simply don’t care to deliver a good experience for online ordering because there are so many serious problems, minor frustrations and obnoxiously overpriced order fees. You’re really just better off picking up food from a restaurant, actually going outside and getting food for takeout or outdoor seating, or just using a different service. This review was a long time coming for me, and I genuinely hope that less people use Seamless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/381840917/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6370840134,https://appfollow.io/app/50238/review/234453394?s=global2,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/my-first-workspace/reviews/485149?review_id=234453394

You can do this with any type of food, the results have nothing to do with what you type in.

7/10/2020 20:12,381840917,,us,en,2020.39.1,Gabbertoons,2,Confusing and I Create Apps for a Living,"For the basic ordering of food, it’s fine. Too many steps to read reviews, and some big chains don’t display reviews, so why a particular franchise location has such a low rating is hard to discern. I err on the side of caution and do t order from them. 

The worst part of the app is the experience of signing-up for Seamless plus. I tried twice and it took four phone calls to get it right. 

I singed up as prompted during a check out with a restaurant. The itemised membership for $9.99 was right there. But a day later, the app still prompted me at every turn to sign-up. I could see no sign in account settings it was active. And no free deliveries for Seamless + participating businesses. 

First call I was told it would take 48 hours. Second call I was told I had signed up for Grub Hub plus and not Seamless+. Really? Inside the Seamless app. Insisted I had done so. So I tried again. Had to call back to get a refund for GrubHub+, and to see my status as a member. Still, some restaurants were charging for delivery while being listed CLEARLY as free delivery and being a Seamless+ participant.

By the way, the delivered order still showed it to be out for delivery and would for five days. 

Third call I was told, I kid you not, some restaurants participating in Seamless+ don’t offer free delivery. So I had a perk for free delivery for just such a place, which was $5 off AND free delivery. I apply the perk and the line-item order at checkout listed a delivery fee (no free indicator), a service fee (said to be waived because of Seamless+), and no indication of the $5 off where it is usually listed. Instead there was a line item marked separately and NOT adding up to the delivery fee, service fee, and $5 off. 

Fourth call and the rep claimed that was the Seamless+ freebies and the $5 off. Also claimed my refund for the never-wanted GrubHub membership had been applied when it had not. I had to demand it there on the phone. This refund had been promised to be next day and it had been a week. 

In summary: either there are hidden rules you can never be aware of, or this app shares data with the GrubHub app and confuses them. The order summary sometimes doesn’t show the discount(s) in a manner that accounts for perks, etc clearly. You might be signed up for another service entirely without being able to see this. And customer service can’t do much more than apologize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/381840917/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6511265527,https://appfollow.io/app/50238/review/238895155?s=global2,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/my-first-workspace/reviews/485149?review_id=238895155

I have been using it for a long time and previously would be able to filter by cuisine, and then also type in a type of food I’m looking for.

You would type this into the search field and then you would get every restaurant that serves ice coffee which is almost all of them.

It’s my favorite food delivery app because it’s easy to search for individual restaurants as well as types of food. Unlike Uber Eats, there’s no pressure to order sooner to get free delivery by pooling your order with someone else’s, and it’s generally cheaper than Uber Eats too. The order tracking is not as sophisticated as Uber Eats, but I don’t necessarily care to know where the driver is at every second. Recently, it seems like order fees have gone up, so I bought Seamless+. I think it’s a good value so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/381840917/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6623873439,https://appfollow.io/app/50238/review/241292025?s=global2,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/my-first-workspace/reviews/485149?review_id=241292025

I have always enjoyed your service in the city, and the well thought and memorable ad campaigns. However, when hungry, order delivery times and processing of payments are not congruent. 

Most, proceed to checkout, after the entirety of the order has been checked 3x. And after entering new information to satisfy the payment, and to complete to await the delivery ETA. 

It sent another prompt, to confirm payment, which still resembled the itemized receipt. As it retained my order & special request. 

I feel it would be best, to not have this redundancy here, for both you and the restaurants. I hope you will be able to look into the OS platforms for the app-to streamline and simplify...because NY is 24h and we are hungry 😂",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/381840917/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6680957406,https://appfollow.io/app/50238/review/242553558?s=global2,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/my-first-workspace/reviews/485149?review_id=242553558

IMO the best design was a few years ago when all menu items were categorized and you could easily select an item from a restaurant using this system. 

This is obviously a case of marketing having too many cooks in the kitchen and wanting to “fix” something that isn’t broken. I empathize with the design team.

I get that you need to make money but were you not making plenty prior to this?? I get that you have to pay staff but this price gouging is only ensuring their tips are reduced. Your customers cannot afford to keep up with your pricing & most Are likely using your app far LESS now. I know I am. And like many, I’m using other apps more since you’ve officially exceeded their costs AND your deliveries are still far from the degree of professionalism they OUGHT TO BE, ESPECIALLY at these prices. 

Regularly missing items, condiments and cutlery always missing, even large items in separate bags missing, like shakes or sodas. It honestly costs the same or even less to use far more advanced services like Post Mates. And you never have the constant deals that Uber Eats offers. 

Yes, you/Grub Hub is usually there to take calls and make good on missing items, COLD, super late or disgusting food (when restaurant’s fault—EXCEPT when closed & you make us wait) BUT like I said, at these prices, there should NOT be major or constant issues. Furthermore, missing items typically means one or more person has their meal ruined and just paying back that particular item does little to remedy that. Even IF a missing items is picked up by the driver and brought to us, it still isn’t very helpful bc by then, meals are over and/or fresh/hot food is now soggy and cold, etc. 

Honestly, I really, REALLY can’t afford or justify these major price increases and I’m going to be picking up my own food or using other services for the majority of the time, going forward.",,,4/12/2020 17:08,"Hello an actual human who's deserate, Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your experience.

Literally every single time my pie comes with all the cheese slid off to one side because the drivers never carry the pies right. I don’t know why seamless doesn’t route cars to pick up the orders from this spot. The guys on mopeds always mess it up and I’ve taken to writing messages immediately to the driver saying “please carry the pizza correctly Or I will complain”. Yes, if I forget to write that, it will show up banged up. I’m sick of it. And I’m tired of the customer care people trying to offer me a discount on my next order. I didn’t order pizza soup. I shouldn’t be scraping it off the cardboard. 

Send the right people to deliver pizzas or don’t offer the service. This is stupid. I’m cancelling my seamless plus service and I’m done. Terrible service in NYC unless you’re ordering something packaged suer well that the driver couldn’t mess up if they tried.",,,8/6/2021 03:04,"Hello Isuamadog,

The following is now true after every single update. The app will work for a week, they update it, then it will give an error while loading restaurants. Only loads a handful of restaurants. No more than that before I get an error. So basically I’m limited to searching within a quarter mile as I sort by distance. The latest update is not loading restaurants. It’s stops and says can’t load more... error. Customer service is of no help. They tell you the generic... delete and redownload the app. Keep doing it. Still doesn’t work. And why is it it that a restaurant gets labeled a “go-to” when I’ve only ordered there once? I see restaurants that had terrible food and I would never order from again come up as a go to? Says who?? Why? Why is Seamless deciding that for us? Why can’t we choose what our favorites are? This app keeps getting worse and worse. I’m sure grubhub is no better as they are the same company and my grubhub account was hacked.
